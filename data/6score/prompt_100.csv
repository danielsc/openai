"General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and I'd be surprised if you don't walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... ""Mistakes are inevitable, it's how we recover from them that is important""!!!

Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. You've got a customer for life!! .......... :^)

"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.

"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.

"Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!

###

"
"Great prices, great food. The staff is very friendly... I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch on a more regular basis. I had the kung pao, and the portions were incredible for the $5 I paid. 

Not mind blowing, but better than most Chinese places I've been to in the Valley.

"I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them! 

A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these.

I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful. 

Service was great! I'll be back!

"I LOVE Chic Nails!

I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were ""too busy"" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. 

The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!

P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)

"Absolutely the best sushi in the valley, hands down.  The fish is fresh and their spicy tuna is like no other.  However, the service is extremely slow. We once waited 75 minutes to get our lunch and the restaurant wasn't even full.  Can't say much about the cooked food though, but the sushi is amazing.

###

"
"That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars. 

The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not. 

Service was great. 

I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)

"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good."" 

Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later. 

Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches.

"This is my 2nd time to this AMC.  I like it!  It is huge and clean.  The wait for tickets were quick and they have it set up that it is a hotel check in.  Not behind a bullet proof pawn shop set up.  LOL!  The concession area was huge with mutliple lines open.  Not much of a wait either.  

Walked into theater #10, not too shabby.  Pretty big screen and clean seats.  The speakers sounded great.  I had a great time.

"I'd love to give these guys a better review, because they were very friendly and professional.  However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!

When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.  I am really dissapointed that the attention to detail just wasn't there.  I was expecting so much more from a detail job.

"Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.

"I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...

The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.

###

"I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.

"What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.

Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.

I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.

###

"
"Other then the chips and salsa (5 stars for salsa) the food is good, but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there. The fajitas are delish, with mushrooms and the meat always tender, but the price makes me cringe. At over $20 there are so many other places I rather eat. I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally....
But overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good.

"I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a ""glorified Red Lobster""). 

I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food. 

The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying. 

I can't wait to come back here.

###

"
"The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that ""I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour"" feeling.

The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  

I am hooked!

###

"
"I have visited MacAlpine's a few times, and every time I have been very pleased with both the food and the service.  The wait staff and the owners are always very friendly and helpful and the food, although nothing fancy, is always good.  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant as well as the neighboring thrift shop that is fun to browse while the food cooks.  And the egg cream sodas are delicious!  Not to mention visiting a piece of Phoenix history at the same time - I love it!  The only downside to this place? I wish they were open later into the evening...

###

"
"I've never eaten at this location; both times I've had it was to-go. The first time I had a pulled pork sandwich, and a side of the beans. The pork was extremely dry and tasteless without the sauce. The sauce I found was overly seasoned. And the beans had way too much pepper. 

The second time I had HB's was a work lunch that we had this delivered. Once again, the pork was completely dry, but not as dry as the pulled chicken, which my coworkers complained about. 

I prefer Hap's BBQ over this place for sure.

###

"
"The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good.

I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no.

Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no.

###

"I used to frequent the Lost Leaf almost daily starting the day they opened, unfortunately I cannot say the same anymore. I used to love the refrigerator full of beers, the music, and the cool little home, not to mention the biggest thing, the promise of a full bar. Now, everytime I go there it's full of douchebags, they are out of the beer I want, and the music has somehow become sucky. Perhaps the biggest kicker... there is still no full bar! The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality. And I swear if I see one more dude with girls jeans trying to look cool with a bomber of the worst beer imaginable I'm gonna snap.

Thanks for ruining what could have been an awesome hang out spot guys.

###

"
"Probably the most overrated place in the Phoenix area. There pizza tastes way too much like their canned tomato sauce and there is always a wait to be seated. 

That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca.

###

"
"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.  

Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.

The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)

The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!""

On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.

"OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day... 

The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course. 

Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake? 

Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.

###

"
"My boyfriend and I were in Arizona on vacation for a wedding. The food was better than the average deli and they give you a free cookie with your order too. It is a shame they don't have these in malls near me. Although I read on their website that they have one at the Galleria which would have been nice when I lived in Davis, CA for college. 

Shopping really works up an appetite and this satisfied it well. and light enough not to ruin a dinner as we had a wedding to attend later that evening.

###

"
"I stopped in one afternoon and ordered some baba and a chicken salad. The baba was good, and served with a ton of pita quarters. The salad was good too, except that most of the chicken was burnt. 
The cashier was pleasant and must be related to the guys doing the cooking. They were giving her a hard time about a male customer who I guessed must come in a lot and she was giving it right back to them! Kinda funny. I will definitely be back for takeout and lunch again while shopping. I will go for the gyro salad next time though.

###

"I had been craving sushi steadily for about two weeks, so I decided to try somewhere new. This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. 

I had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.

My girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. 

The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. 

I would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.

###

"I love Chez Nous for the dancing, the live music is always great, but this past Friday I was really disappointed.  The cover charge has been raised to $7, the drinks were weak, and I got charged $9 for a Three Olives and Coke.  Combine that with being cash only so getting hit for $3 at the ATM inside the bar, and after one poor drink I was already at $20.  Maybe it's because I've gone back to being a broke college student, but I found the whole experience disappointing.  It seems like a few articles in the AZ Republic recently and the prices are flying through the roof.  So for now, I think I'm going to take a break from our relationship... sorry Chez Nous

###

"The only place I go for a nice lunch on Mill. Two words: Beet Salad. Thank me later.

###

"
"I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, I'm super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest.

"This dry-rub barbecue was delicious. The ""sassy"" barbecue sauce was meh, but the sweet was good enough to make up for it.

"We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu. 

The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. 

We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest) 

Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot.

###

"So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!

They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food. 

Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (""Yum-O"" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon! 

Check this place out!

"Great brewery and open atmosphere!  Had the Buffalo Chickens sandwich.  It was great.  Washed it down with a Sunspot Golden Ale which was awesome.  Will return to sample the other beers.  Making a reservation online worked like a champ.

"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!

"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!

Drinks
1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice. 
2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.

Food
1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing.
2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.

"Phenom. 
The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila. 
Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice. 
It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be. 
The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made. 
I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish. 
Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure. 
Service is friendly and quick. 
I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale. 
Good food. You won't be disappointed.

"Good, but the salad was not as good as remembered.  Still think its a great spot in scootsdale!

"Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!

"I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.

We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!

"
"A definite favorite in the neighborhood.

The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive.

"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of ""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! 

 Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.

"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!

"great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular

"I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?

"After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.  

I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).

Highlights:
Tasty drink menu
Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style
Great part of town
Sexy servers...dang

Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!

"This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.

###

"Enjoyed sitting outside and the barra viejo shrimp dish.  I didn't find anything ""to die for"" but it's good.  More importantly it was a nice evening and I enjoyed the experience very much.  My waiter was very laid back and friendly.  I didn't feel rushed and was able to have a relaxed dinner.  Case in point- I'm usually a one-drink girl, but I had 2 that day.

###

"
"Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different.

###

"
"Really nice jumping point for a good night in Phoenix. Crab Cake Sandwich was great!

###

"
"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.

###

"
"I am so not a fan of the dentist.  But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.  Professional, yet relaxed attitudes.  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.

While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's ""Smile"" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  

I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?

I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.

I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.

"Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.  
The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.  
My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.   
My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!

###

"
"Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.

###

"
"Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).  

Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday!

I've never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi.

Recommendations:
Signature Roll
Squid Salad
Yellowtail Collarbone
Drinks, Drinks...drinks.

They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well.

1 Thing: When it's busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting.

"what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.) 

I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical. 

the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?) 

the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. 

The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)

If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either. 

What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!

"This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.

###

"
"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!

"
"I know its gonna sound a bit foolish when I divulge that I was actually a bit scared to enter the Roadrunner Lounge, but the truth is that I was.  Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.

What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.

The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.

In conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!

"Like many of my fellow Yelpers, I too take issue with the ladies at the MAC counter, but not necessarily Nordstrom's as the ""store.""  After using my pressed powder compact to the point of ""crumbs,"" I prepared for battle and a trip to the mall.  But, before leaving home, I checked my email for sales and specials.  What I discovered is the best thing ever!  Yes, this is drum roll worthy - so start tapping!  Nordstrom's offers FREE shipping & FREE returns!  Every item on the website regardless of price can be shipped to your door for (in case you didn't get it the first time) FREE!  Needless to say I put down the sword, took off my armor, and ordered my compact online.  I am now ""crumb-free!""

"Hella, hella pretentious and offering food not at a level to back that up, imo~ No complaints, but nothing worth coming back for.

Really bland tacos, bland beans with tacos, decent portions, nice martinis/cocktails. Lemon tart was lemony. Mushroom pizza was mushroomy. 

Pretty stock Safe White Yuppie Food menu aimed at hitting every upper-class food trend on the map right now. Nothing gets people going like making them feel green AND worldly!

Good wait staff, hostess was not on the ball so much, it was a Thursday night near closing time and there were toddlers crawling on top of some tables on the patio and other such perils of family dining. 

Not a place that I will go on my own or drag my husband to. I understand the appeal for some people, bless their hearts, but this place is just too boring to waste calories on.

###

"
"Maybe I'm being generous, but CPK is an okay place for unique pizza. I've always enjoyed their Santa Fe pizza, but this time I thought I'd try their Greek pizza. It was o-k. Nothing special. Too many veggies, without enough meat, cheese and Tzatziki sauce to counter-balance it. 

What really bothered me was that they sat my sister and me right behind the kitchen. I don't think they should even have a table right there. I saw everything that was going on in there. Plus, I kept hearing the servers complaining to their boss about shit. One girl was saying something about another server ""not liking her."" I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. And, to top it off, it was FREEZING in there. It is never a good idea to have it soooo cold, that your patrons want to get the hell out of there to warm up!

But, besides my few complaints, it is a fine establishment, although it could definitely improve. I'm sure I'll go back again. But, maybe the next time,I'll stick with my old stand by -- the Santa Fe.

"I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.

"It is ALWAYS fun & enlightening to visit an Apple Store as their employees are ALWAYS so helpful!.....now this store is somewhat small and has ""sleepy Scottsdale"" hours of opporation.....opening at noon on Sunday???!!!!.... How 1965 of them.....used to the exceptional hours at the store on  767 5th Avenue in NYC and their 24/7.....but you CAN schedule genius classes as early as 9:00......so all in all another great Apple Store experience and Will be back for iPad 2 next week!

"Wow.

Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... 

I know where I'm going tonight.

"Going to keep this review short and to the point...

Service: Most of the time horrible. Typical waiting forever at the bar for a drink, if I can even get thru to the bar... Bartenders seem to be oblivious to serving patrons in a fair first-come-first serve fashion...Major dislike

Atmosphere: Trendy and hip. Except for the excessive desperate looking cougars trying to cash in on fake rich or really young ripped Jersey Shore looking guys. The cougars are just minor annoyances, they don't get in the way too much. The majority of the people seem to be pretty cool though.

Pricing: A little steep, but it's Scottsdale. The place could offer a better happy hour. Sunday's bottomless bubbles (champagne) is a great value. 

Food: Portions are pretty small, but are decently priced.

Decor: Outstanding! Job well-done in decorating and furnishing the place. It's really distinctive and luxurious. However, the rough plastic-feeling purple couches do not feel pleasant to the touch. They look like velvet, but are vinyl. Major fail on this! This requires immediate attention.

Patio: Great views and plenty of seating. However, hated how many stupid old smelly cigar smokers were out there clogging up the air. I'm not sure what can be done about these disgusting people, but overall the patio set up is one of the best around...

"Okay...I have been going here for a while and I love the place and the food!  I am surprise it hasn't had as many reviews as it should.  The truth is I come back to support local businesses in my neighborhood...I would come here anyday than go to a Fast Food burger joint..

The trailor that the restaurant is in is the cutest thing you will ever see...straight out of a 50's picture!  Its small but fitting...

The food is very fresh..I love their cheeseburgers and hotdogs..I sometimes even get some of their mango salsa/chutney on the side..they get it from this lady that homemakes it..
Not the cleanliness place but I guess thats what makes it tastes so great!!:)  Its the extra grease...I know that just sounds horrible, but true!

Anyways, support locals and their businesses...go go go!!!

"As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.

"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY.

###

"
"This restaurant = a great experience. Everything about this place is fabulous. The server was extremely attentive, the food was fresh and delicious, and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for.

ENTREE

For starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.

I ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.

DESSERT

They have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.

AMBIANCE/SERVICE

The waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant. 

I would definitely go back to SOL. Maybe tomorrow..

###

"
"My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!

###

"
"I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus, they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)

###

"
"This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.

###

"
"I'm on a low carb diet right now, so I had to pass on the pizza, unfortunately.  I was expecting to order a house salad with chicken.  When I told the server my diet limitations, she suggested a side of meatballs for about $4.  It was perfect.  I had the smallest bill at the table, and the meatballs were homemade and plenty tasty.

###

"
"I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me. 

I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.

###

"
"I was NOT too impressed with this place but...  it was good for Phoenix, where I am starting to realize there is NOT an abundance of people who look like me.  =/   LOL! 

Flavor-wise I thought it was pretty good.  Don't be misled by the spring rolls...  Even though it says they serve them in 3s...  its 3 that are cut in half...  so you get 6 pieces.  This is pretty good if you're looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this.

I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be.

When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change?

I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  I've eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.  

Oh well...

"Holy manfest '07.
I think I was one of the 20 women (not including the waitresses) in Tilted Kilt yesterday.
It was raining men.  And I liked it. 
A few minutes after entering the bar, I knew exactly why I was surrounded by a sea of men- the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes. 
Let me clarify: they did have tiny skirts on, even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out, so I guess that constitutes as clothes.
The outfits were cute, but extremely revealing, so much so that even I had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and I know the guys around me were having the same problem.
The bartenders (all men) were all pretty cute. And wearing kilts.  All I kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work.
The food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive.  You'll find the usual apps, sandwiches, tons of salads, chicken fingers, wings and so on. 
But the real highlight of Tilted Kilt for me was when I found little purse hooks underneath the bar. I thought that was awesome. 
Way to look out for the ladies Tilted Kilt.

###

"
"One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver.

###

"
"I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time. I would never ever go back there. The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad. The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions. To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone . So rude and bad customer service. It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!!

###

"
"I adore Radio Milano. Tried to hit it up this last Thursday evening and found it to be closed. I was really depressed by this as I have had my eye on the deviled eggs and the beautiful bartender boy the last couple of times I've dined here. (neither of which I've been able to try yet...booooo!!) 

According to the valet guy across the street at Postino they are scheduled to re-open in early April. Apparently with somewhat more of a ""lounge like"" feel or some such nonsense. Works for me!  I hope they keep the Tuna Crudo around which is just insanely good. Drown yourself in some chocolate pudding for desert, you won't regret it. Ahhhhh, now I'm hungry... don't worry about me, he was too pretty to be straight anyway.

###

"Really cool, foodie restaurant in scottsdale. All the food was fresh and original. The service was quick and pleasant, and definitely a place to consider to eat. It's not the cheapest restaurant but worth the price. This place definitely belongs in Scottsdale as is more upscale and you could sense it from the decor and service.

###

"
"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent. 

What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob.

###

"
"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.

My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey. 

I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.

"I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.

I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.

The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.

Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.

The Food:

* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.
* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.
* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good
* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.
* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.
* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.

All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.

"Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.

"I live in downtown Phoenix; Boyfriend lives in Tempe. After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.

In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.

The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars. We both really wanted to like this place, but I think next time we want to get dressed up and go out on the East side, we'll try somewhere else. In the meantime, we'll stick to downtown.

"I've been coming to this place since college, and I can tell you its definitely one of those ""an oldie but a goodie"".  So, its not a fancy schmancy place with hip party music playing and it doesn't serve mixed drinks with cute names like ""hello kitty"", but it should be a staple to anyone's lunch place repertoire.  

They serve bento boxes (basically a lunch box with rice, your choice of entree, salad and slices of oranges--a healthy dessert!) for $3.75.  If you're feeling like a high roller, you can order the sashimi bento box, and that will set you back a whopping $6.

Who says you can't eat good for cheap?

"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)

Short Review:

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review:
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. 

The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. 

The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!

The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""?? 

The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!

If any of this appeals to you this is your place! 

BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)

"Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.

"The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale. 

Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows. 

The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.

"I was sent to Amomi spa from my OBGYN for my  first pregnancy to get all of my ultrasounds.  I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff. Every ultrasound technician I have had has been really great and knowledgable.  I really like that they have high tech equipment with big plasma tv's on the wall so I could see a big,clear picture of the baby. Also, the  large spacious rooms are really nice. On a side note, they have great products to buy in the lobby.

Now pregnant with my 2nd baby, my OB referred me to 2 different places this time for my ultrasounds. Without hesitation I knew I wanted to go back to Amomi spa again to get all of my ultrasounds. I have already been twice this time around and looking forward to going again in a few weeks.
