Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide who's style most mirrors what you're looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. He's a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while he's working on you, and he doesn't dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). He's very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft.",review,Xm8HXE1JHqscXe5BKf0GFQ,1,2,0,13

LDJhwZN14AZOJyHjg2lkRw,2011-12-13,hHwQaL3QN2xgTBSCQ26wIA,4,"We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol).  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  The theater itself is fine.  The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.  

They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.  It wasn't bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it.",review,Mb0psF4WQF7gZSuZafVr-g,0,0,0,13

No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming. You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!

The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of ""fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas... 

We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix.

Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  

Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.

The guacamole is always fresh, the burrito's are big and there are lot's of add-ins.  Just don't expect any gustatory excitation, it's pretty basic, non-threatening, and I think I heard somebody refer to it as gabacho mexican food.  I think that pretty well sums it up.

JhupPnWfNlMJivnWB5druA,2010-08-18,INgYGonM78YMB-5vpfoPQQ,5,"AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.

You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.

Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.

They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.

Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not.

And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.

I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. 

Breakfast: 

Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. 

Lunch:

Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind.

well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.

so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash, lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?

i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.

First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)

Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming.

Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. 

Experiences with the order could be as follows: 
Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. 
Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. 
Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. 
Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert.

This is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons. 

First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.

The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.

Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! 

The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. 

We just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.",review,thdVzCfKx-DV0zYWqId3pw,0,1,0,13

Let me just say, I LOVE MUDDLED DRINKS, I am not a fan of cosmos or martini's or anything that just tastes like strong alcohol - BLAH! For me stronger isn't better, flavor and uniqueness is better! This place has by far the best muddled drinks I have ever had! If you just want to go for drinks they have this cute little drink bar right before you enter the restaurant - separate from the main dining which I thought was nice. The decor is romantic latin! I love it! 

We started our dinner first by receiving these potato rolls. OMG where have these been my entire life!!!!???!! They are just fall apart in your mouth good! We both ordered mambo mango drinks - STELLAR! We then got the tres ceviches (lobster escabeche / mixto clasico / ruby red tuna) the lobster was the best! But all very good. However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM!

My husband got the jidori chicken and myself the adobo pork. Both were good but not GREAT. Too much seasoning on my pork. To me this place is a MUST go to for drinks and small bites. I would have given this place five stars but the entrees just didn't do it for us. However, it was not horrible - just okay. The rest of our experience with dinner - service, restaurant ambiance, overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING!

Although, the meat and presentation is great. Anything you want sent right to your table and cooked however you would like. Just don't leave your card on the green for too long otherwise you will have more meat than you can handle.

On the other hand, the specialty drinks are good. I don't recall the name of it but they served a traditional Brazilian drink that was wonderful. Not as strong for my liking but good.

Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.

The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)

I'll try it again though. Food was OK, not great.

We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",review,2qnz2y_Z1nDo2HqqfxJxSA,0,0,0,13

So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.

ENTREE

For starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.

I ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.

DESSERT

They have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.

AMBIANCE/SERVICE

The waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant.

I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.

So the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.

That was when they pulled out dessert.

I'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.

I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.

Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.

While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks.",review,lczLjHO7zIhrmSlOXI3ohg,1,1,1,13

I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms.""

Anyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a ""Jesus toast"" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.

So when I told my waiter I was having a ""bad toast experience"" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the ""toast"" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal"".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?

Ok, now all the anger is stirred up... I must say that My florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rate-amazing.  She truly plays from her soul and her personality shines through in her interpretations of classic songs.  I have been there since the ""toast experience"", but make my friend arrive first to look for the waiter with the ponytail!",review,yaw_aNmYB-BNOoPTkzD69Q,2,1,2,13

Then people say ""Oh I don't like IPA's"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.

uPDTnuR-sOi47blHH943lg,2011-11-21,bNEamJDVe7MzNSVtPRXx7Q,5,"My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.

My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.

She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.

Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  

This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.

And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.

I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.

During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.

These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.

PoRYjYUSjmeWM1WLsx_45w,2007-10-23,6b5sifuzXWw0cMd_8c9how,3,"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.",review,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA,4,5,4,13

Second, I decided to give them a try for an early Friday dinner, about 5 in the evening. There were a few people dining in the restaurant, and quite a few people on staff for the evening. The dining room is pretty well decorated, more so than I thought it would be, giving a faux Hawaiian feel to it. Seeing some people there at that time gave me hope for a good meal.

I asked the lady manning the counter what was good, and she took a bit of time to walk me through the menu. Emphasizing the plate lunches, I decided to try the Combo that would get me the most variety. I elected for terriyaki beef and kalua pork. I took the side of the 'potato mac' and got my meal to go.

Arriving home, my meal sat for about 5 minutes before I had it unboxed and ready to enjoy. Considering that fact, everything was in pretty good condition. The potato mac was a bit more room temperature than cold, but that was my own doing. The rice stayed warm, the pork moist and really flavorful, and the beef sweet and tender.

Having dined at a few places offering plate lunches in the past, the potato mac was probably what sold me as much as the meats on why I'll return. Potato mac's tend to have a pretty flat flavor, and when I find out how Hawaiian's garnish them, I will be excited to get some more flavor in them. But it was just the right amount of dry ... I've had many potato mac's that are just too wet, but this felt about perfect.

I'll give the fish dishes a try in the future and report on those. But I really enjoyed what I experienced and well give it a second (and probably more) pass.",review,-nkYxSyYTQNIlj_D3fJGag,0,3,0,13

I've eaten here for over a decade. I've brought friends, college classmates, relatives, and dates here. I lost my dad 3 years ago and I have fond memories of dining here with him. I distinctly remember spilling a Coke all over myself the first time I brought him here. I also remember coming here on my very last day of law school, with a bunch of classmates from Employment Law. The folks here have seen their share of special occasions in my life. Wouldn't be true if this were truly just a 2 star experience. 

I don't think it's fair to nail a restaurant with a bad review based on only a single visit, in most circumstances. Restaurants are run by humans, who are allowed to have a bad day now and then. I've eaten here a billion times. Occasionally something has annoyed me. Most of the time the service is prompt. And those things are true of every restaurant I've ever frequented more than once. At JOTC, even if it's not prompt, it has not even once been unfriendly. There is an elderly gentleman waiter in particular who I especially like. A non-Indian friend I came here with once asked him, ""So, what part of India are you from?"" The waiter look back puzzled and said in his typically mild and hushed manner, ""Sir, I am from Mexico City."" We LOL'd. 

It's #2 on my list of Indian restaurants in the Valley, which is pretty good. Since Tandoori Times is so close by it almost always wins out on a given night, over the past year or so. But the fact remains that JOTC is solidly #2. 

The food is good, by my Indian standards. Samosas: awesome. Chicken tikka masala: very good. I tried the bhindi masala once and that didn't turn out too well. A unique JOTC feature is that dishes are served in very cute, traditional-looking, brass or copper Indian pots. 

Little details like that lead me to say that the decor and atmosphere here probably beat out Tandoori Times and every other Indian place. Simple but elegant, with old Indian art on the walls and cool room dividers thoughtfully placed throughout. The outdoor seating is very pleasant, with heaters to warm you up during winter. The location only adds to the reason to eat here. It's in a cool space next to the Scottsdale Civic Center, a few yards away from AZ 88. It's a solid place to come with a group to eat, drink, and enjoy some good conversation.

JOTC doesn't blow me away (thus only 4 stars), but it needs to be said that if you live in the Valley it is worth at least one visit if you like Indian food, which you wouldn't be able to tell from the other reviews. Judge for yourself.",review,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw,1,3,0,13

I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.
I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  
The server behing the bar was ""professionally friendly""  
Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.
Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.
The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.
The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong ""and vinegary"". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.
The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is. 

I would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good.

There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  

First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!

Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.

First of all, the building and atmosphere is awesome. I think it used to be a Bank of America? They really outdid themselves with the renovations and decor.

Service was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant. 

When it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time. 

Vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasn't impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu. With a side of their yummy spicy mayo.

Talking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious. The parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior. It kind of ruined the mood for us. I wish they would have just gone to Peter Piper like most kids teams do after a game...

Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course. 

We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isn't as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it.

The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didn't surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast.

It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isn't as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line.

I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go.",review,mlBC3pN9GXlUUfQi1qBBZA,0,1,0,13

The price was great--as was its proximity to places of interest--and this is why we stayed here. But the free internet and breakfast was not worth the inexpensive price. I would definitely pay more to stay at a nicer place that feels a lot safer. The hotel is neighboring a strip club and the acoustics are terrible. We experienced this fully when our neighbors next door got into a huge verbal altercation at 5:00 AM, where the police were called :( not fun. 

The staff are friendly, but the hotel feels like it is under new management or still opening as everything is very unorganized and unfinished.  The lady would not give me a printed receipt for our stay. Another example: they have microwaves in the rooms, but not microwaves safe plates to use. A little strange?

Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  

The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. 

The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.

The restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.

Bar Smith though? They failed on so many levels. 

I got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!! 

I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down. 

At that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there. 

After finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture. 

Also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up. 

By the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible. 

Even at the end of the night, there were people standing in line waiting to get upstairs. Bar Smith gets a huge ""F"" as far as I'm concerned. I won't be back to this place for any headlining DJ. They obviously don't know how to run an event.",review,FHJUj7EHB9nB2czVOzQX3Q,3,7,3,13

This is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss.

It's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat. 

I know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection. 

The service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye. 

Oh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. ""Hold the butter."" May save you some pain.",review,GLMX8Is_Ur6aIVV86Ok0Lw,15,15,17,13

We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion.",review,U0jr6zPZM-EZRN5EFej6HA,0,0,0,13

I fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered  the Good Ass burger, which was avocado and bacon, so you can't really go wrong with that. The fries were good and the burger was pretty good.

1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!

2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.

The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.

Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.

It was our first visit.  I was familiar with Mia Francesca (""MF"") as a friend of mine, who lives in Chicago, has, since God invented dirt, rated her local MF as an out-n-out favorite.  And her word is the ever lovin' gospel when it comes to food.  I mean, I don't even collect $200 -- I just go.  KnowhatI'msayin?

Onward, with the review!

Kyle was our server (and he might be the bartender, too) was very friendly, informative and attentive.  Then we find out he's a fellow Texas boy...which classifies his attributes as hardwired.  What's more, he treats his job like it was his own business; e.g., at the end of the meal he gave us a business card and added he would enjoy serving us the next time.  And there will be a next time and a next time and a next time.  

Semi-quick facts, anyone?  (It's rare a Texan has a short story.).  

-- Good, warm bread; accompanying olive oil was herbaceous and handily decanted from a table-set bottle
-- Da Beau ordered a starter of (peeled!) asparagus with tomatoes and gorgonzola that was lightly dressed with a tangy vinaigrette.  The leftover tomatoes and 'zola were a treat atop the warm, oil-dipped bread
-- We both ordered -- and consumed to the point of making a happy plate -- the barrumunda atop lentils and sauteed spinach.  This was our first tasting of barrumunda.  A moderately white fish, it is native to the rivers of Australia and reminded me of good ol' Texas catfish.  (Note to self:  fry-up a batch of panko-crusted barrumunda at home.).  The three fillets of fish, lentils and spinach were perfectly seasoned (read:  a smidgen of salt).  

Again, pay no attention to the reviews, here, about bad service.  Yet, let's say those reviews make an impression.  Ok, if you have any reservations about dining here, go anyway and ask to be seated in Kyle's station.",review,wSSlEV1KRoKgxVNTz3A-oA,0,0,0,13

~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed.
~Attentive, but not aggressive server...great attitude! 
~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven. 
~Homemade infused alcohol.. finally in Phoenix! 
~Open kitchen, I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal. 

All items served ""tapas"" style... great opportunity to try many items! 

Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience... either enjoy the food natural, or enhance with dipping sauces. These are not the heavy, sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame. 

~Mango Spring roll.. light, fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced 

~Soup Gyoza, 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate broth..divine! 

~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone, then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts,... try a dip of the accompanying sauce...ecstasy, prepare to order 2 they're so good! 

~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp ""hushpuppys"".. very good, but not the highlight of the evening.. Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion. 

~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique, yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian ""slaw"" 

~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these.. familiar flavors, with wonderful dipping sauces. 

No-one in our party was disappointed... everyone was very pleased and anxious to return.

I haven't seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and I'm no spring chicken).  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD.

The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.  Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.  Not with NGD.  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas. 

Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly.

1.  Bacon mixed with everything under the sun.  Bacon doesn't need an accompaniment, it's amazing all on its own.  No more bacon donuts.  Please, for the love.

2.  Overuse of truffle oil.  Dumping truffle oil on a dish does not make it gourmet.  Please stop.  For real.

Culinary Dropout is guilty of succumbing to these two trends.  That being said, the service and atmosphere make it forgivable.  Our server and the manager were hyper aware of how long we'd been waiting.  Even though it was not that big of a deal to us, it was nice to know they cared.

They mean well when it comes to cocktails, but they were a little lightweight for me, relying heavily on simple syrup and mixers to dumb down the alcohol.  Their beer list made up for it, though.  I've never had a stout in a can, but they managed to find the brewery that pulled it off.

Yeah, my ricotta gnocchi was drenched in truffle oil, but the sausage and mushrooms made it actually a pretty good dish.  And the beets were fresh and delicious.

I'd rather eat at a really shitty place that I'll remember than a so-so eatery that I'll forget the moment I get back into my truck.

If I want mediocre ""take it or leave it"" food I'll just cook for myself, kthxbye.

As BFeF's (Best Frienemies Forever), Clarice W and I frequently have lunch together in the Peoria area. The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where haven't we been that we can yelp about?

Our last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back.

Clarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lenny's Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue.

We were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as ""that fucking guy"". 

At first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought ""but  man, I love her mother's cooking..."". 

But aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners.

I can't tell if this means there's more to the cuisine than I'm aware of or that said ex's mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar. 

Either way, I'm glad I left her in the end anyway.

I ordered the Dinguan, which translates as ""chocolate pork"".

Don't be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate.

Chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pig's blood. 

I'll repeat that.

It's pig's blood. It's called ""chocolate pork"" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after it's been cooked.

After hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! aren't we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like.

All the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. I'm not sure if it's jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option. 

And if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesn't even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didn't get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice. 

Thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice. 

That's right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo.

I couldn't taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They could've just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though.

Clarice wasn't as fortunate with her dish. While I've tried to stay away from beef (it's enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if that's how it's meant to taste.

Moral of the story: Clarice's entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient. 

And seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal. 

As the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax. 

My tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply.

Clarice's creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon.

On our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit.

After I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go.

What I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that you'd get at Fry's. Essentially, a diabetes sandwich.

With an awesome mix of Old School Funk, Reggae, Classic Rock, and even a little Santana action, the live band was ON POINT! We were singing and dancing to every song! The crowd was fairly diverse and everyone was friendly. I could definitely see this as a relaxing place to go after a long day, where you don't necessarily have to wear ""club attire"" to fit in.

The name itself ""Revo Burrito, Revolutionary Mex"" set me up thinking I was walking into...a revolutionary burrito joint!  My husband and I were disappointed to say the least.  He had the Chicken Machaca Burrito, which the counter girl said was her favorite.  And it was, well, just a chicken burrito, at best.  There was so much liquid oozing out the bottom from the wet lettuce and wet pico that he had to move his chips to another plate because they were swimming.  I had the Black Bean Burrito.  The menu had stated the beans were slow simmered in garlic, onions & seasonings...sounded delish!  However it tasted like they walked next door to Safeway and bought a can of black beans, heated them up and rolled them into a tortilla.  It was also supposed to include their ""special cheese blend"" AND there was only a SLIGHT SPRINKLE of cheese...literally!  I actually opened up the tortilla to make sure they didn't forget it.  Call me crazy, but when I order a bean & CHEESE burrito, I'd like to have at least a small amount of cheese.  I guess their idea of special cheese is magical, disappearing cheese.

The rice with corn & a drizzle of cream was especially delicious & the fresh-squeezed lemonade was tart & perfectly sweetened. We also liked the decor & the windowed kitchen.

I've passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.

We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.

Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.

Because without the brick-and-mortar there would be no former. 

So, tonight for the first time Robert M and I joined the Fez Foodies for a sneak peak at a few items that will be coming to a plate near you. The raspberry spinach salad was wonderful. The steak with mushrooms and smashed red potatoes might need another consideration but was still a pleasant entree. Honestly, I look forward to returning and getting these items, because Fez actually takes customer input/suggestions and applies them. 

Fez is one of those locations where I've never gotten anything but terrific service and a great meal. I'm fond of the garlic and rosemary fries but my coworkers and friends and strangers on the light rail think I should limit myself on these as some people don't appreciate the proven medical benefits of bucket-loads of garlic and shovelfuls of rosemary.

If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.

I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, ""chicken fried rice, right?"" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.

Or at least their version of it.

I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.

Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.

Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away.

I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me.

I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christopher's truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was ""on it"". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range. 

We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive.
As for the food, well, it's Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride.

Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say ""Christmas Party""?",review,RWtDRHpLnPBDjDVdKWh6uQ,1,1,1,13

I saw a piece in the local rag about C4 and since we're already in Moon Valley I say 'how 'bout it'. Jeff agrees and we're off - 

We arrived just before 4 - closing time and the bartender/waitperson was reeeeally nice. She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off. No worries, we remain unfazed. We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace. The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in. We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich. I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef. The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers, cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo [not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same] on a toasted baguette. Roast beef was similar in scale, lots of meat with melted cheddar, greens also on a toasted baguette. Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle. 

It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon, we didn't feel rushed or in the way. It was just a nice, shoulder dropping, ahhhh experience. Not the spa, but just what the doctor ordered.

Some branches are better than others, some regions are better than others - they're no better or worse than other national chains which also have some good branches and some bad branches. I picked them because they have a great ""rewards program"" and because they have heavy presences in places where I travel often.

So this is a bad branch. There's a couple decent check-out kids, but in general their employees are among the worst trained I've ever seen, in terms of providing polite, timely, friendly customer service. They avoid your eyes when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question. They never EVER greet you with a smile and a ""good morning"" or a ""did you find everything you need?"" while you check out. They have inconsistent policies about whether or not coupons can be scanned from iPhone or paper copies needed (the manager basically called me a liar when I said checkout people have scanned my iPhone coupons many times in the past).

I guess if you sell very profitable liquor and meds, you make money no matter how bad your attitude is. It's not like Walgreens and Rite Aid are setting the world on fire with their customer service either....

The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. 

The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.

The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.

Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santa's little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didn't have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows.... 

During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day).

We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long, warm day in the desert. What we found here was slightly different than we were expecting......The chips were made of corn AND flour tortillas, which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food. The salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro (or maybe even parsley?) for color.
It was ""Taco Tuesday"", which here meant all-you-can-eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices.""Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos"", according to my teen son. Ooops :( I ordered the ""award-winning green chili sweet tamale"". I fear they left the winners with the judges, for they didn't make it to my table. The tamales were dry and contained about a tablespoon of chopped chiles throughout. And, although they were sweet as promised, they lacked depth of flavour overall.
The service was fine and the refills on soft drinks was fair, but I really was hoping for more.

First off, at the time of this writing I've been in Phoenix for about a year. Learning about all the necessary places to go in a new town, I had the opportunity to rate businesses objectively (not like 'My mom always went there so I do too...')

Fry's became a standard 'go to' place. Their hours are great (5 AM to 1 AM). There are many locations, and their prices are very competitive. They also have a convenient VIP card and electronic coupon program.

Specifically to my needs, this location has a good pharmacy, an organic/health selection and a well stocked bakery and deli (for parties and special occasions). Their parking is reasonable and the lot is well kept/secure. There's also a Chase branch nearby as well as a Best Buy, Staples and Old Navy. On Wednesdays there's a Farmer's Market just across the street for everything else I can't find here.

Not all Fry's carry the same things. For instance, I can only depend on this location to carry pita bread, garlic naan, large Fage yogurt as well as the Mexican version of creme fraiche. I appreciate this greatly.

One word of caution, be firm with the staff at the deli. Take a number, insist on their attention, and don't let them gyp you with small wings or the bottom of the pasta selection. I know some of them don't care about their job, but don't let that ruin your experience. Remember: they're probably making minimum wage.

Oh, and the other reviewer's comment about the parking is accurate, although I'm not sure what they can do about it as this is a mall complex.",review,mbgppRfYH0kC7p7X2VPcGg,0,0,0,13

Well, whether it was to apologize or to be sassy I can't say, but either way, I ended up receiving the biggest fattest plate of fresh, hot fries I've ever seen.

Its a lazily, flaccid description for a bar with a fist-full of moxie.  Their Bloody Marys alone feature a fucking brawny-assed, gigantic totem pole of man-meat.  Well, not ""man meat"", but meat-fit-for-a-man.  You get the point.  

Look, the main point is that no ""dive bar"" is gonna be serving yo ass peppers and salami in a $5 tomato Slurpee.  

People often mistake ""kitsch"" as ""obsolete""  and these these are the type of people who would use the word ""psych!"", and grease their side-hair back after swindling you into a fake low-five.  

And i would like to agree with their lowly opinions of Mickey's, but then, I wouldn't want to be wrong also.

If you've ever been to Welcome to the Johnson's in the Lower East Side, and moreover, enjoyed yourself there, then Mickey's is your Arizona equivalent.  Think of it as, Welcome to the Merriweather's.  Scottsdale name, New York kitsch.  

So, their bar service is kinda tough, but once there, they have a kickass selection of brews both ironic and sincere.  You want an Old Style followed by a Boddington's?  Where else but Mickey's?

Their kitchen is open late, which, for the love of all that is holy, is impossible to find in this three-bedroom-two-bath-house of a town.

Even better, their food is goooood.  I mean, heart palpitating good when you consider how delish bar food REALLY CAN be at 2 am.  No, it ain't Capital Grille, get over it, but their wings, fries, chix tenders, et all hit the f'ing spot when you've had too many Jamisons (or Jager/Patron shots for the resident middle schoolers).

They just recently seemed to have remodeled their patio, which looks really great, but lost most of its charm.  Still, space to move and a decent spot to smoke outside beats a macrame couch, or whatever, every day of the week.

The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and it's right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postino's. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip.

There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper.

For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty.

For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I weren't wowed. Maybe it's because the cheese wasn't plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good.

I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are ""No Split Checks"" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.

I'll start with the great.  The restaurant is in a more than 100-year-old house in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  There is nearly a perfect feeling that I have been invited inside someone's home for a fancy dinner party.  The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful. 

The not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldn't have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Don't get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didn't have that over-the-top ""WOW"" factor I was hoping for.

Having said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  It's an enjoyable place to eat.  It's probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer.

As I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.

All 3 tours are distinct and are loaded with excellent restaurants.  I've spent quite a bit of time downtown, but it can be daunting and I haven't ventured much to explore and try new things.  The tours take you to the places you may not notice as you whiz by, give the history (yes Phoenix has history), and overall just slow you down to take in the sights, sounds, and of course, food!

Can't decide which tour to take?  Start with the Original, then the warehouse and finally the evening.  Really, they're all good!  

Tips: Have a light snack before starting the tour.  Yes you do get a lot of food, but keep in mind that the tours start at 2pm or 6pm.  You have introductions, overview, some history and then a short walk to the first restaurant.  If you're skipping lunch, you might be very hungry when you arrive as the first restaurant.  2) Wear comfortable shoes.  You will be walking about 2 miles.  Nothing strenuous or fast paced, but just be conformable (also wear comfortable clothing as you will get full).  3) Pace yourself!  Don't eat everything that is in front of you.  Each restaurant gives a fair amount of food, now multiply that by 3+ more restaurants that remain on the tour...You get the idea.  You will be full!  

Highly recommend for anyone: locals, out of town visitors, guests of locals, team building, etc.  Really, who doesn't like food!

Side Note: Taste it Tours was founded by a few Phoenix locals who love food and their city.  They have only been around about a year now and have been doing extremely well.  They base their business around supporting local businesses (local supporting local).  I'm excited to see how well they've done and wish them all the best (More tours are in the works and I will definitely be taking them!)",review,2MPGdIbaaEdKuW9IpPxHfw,0,1,0,13
EoVGIsaatkdbWLY9qyFcgA,2011-07-14,YV4KrLQJ9z-aMcisXJQ3_Q,2,"I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that I've ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.

I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a ""roasted"" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.

The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.  

While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",review,2qnz2y_Z1nDo2HqqfxJxSA,0,0,2,13

Driving east bound on Indian School Rd. The Watch Repair Company caught my eye in a tiny little strip mall-My prayers had been answered! I pulled quick u-turn and wrangled my car into a spot in their tiny little parking lot. 
Walking into the shop, its not much to look at-but what caught my eye is that is was CLEAN! Pristine to say the least-a nice change from most watch places that typically are cluttered with pieces as I think most watch/clock repair business's lean towards being hoarders :) 
It turns out the shop is under new ownership as of a few months ago (so give it another try Coda B.!) and the owner himself Eddie was upfront working on a piece. 
I only needed a battery replaced, but he did so within 5 minutes and only charged me $5.00. 
What impressed me more than his timeliness, was the fact that he actually knows his timepieces. I was wearing a watch that he offered to clean for me and upon inspection noted that not only was it a beautifully designed piece, but that it was a custom piece by a smaller designer-surely hard to find just anywhere. He was dead-on, the watch was a honeymoon gift my husband purchased for me while in Capri, Italy.

One of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.

My next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait.

6md4A90THda31wTg1bB3hg,2011-01-24,4WqC6X-pmTr7sUs_puPd-w,3,"Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a ""New York"" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.

Slices just has their ""NY"" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do ""NY"" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an ""NY"" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.

On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order ""eat-in"". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept. 

The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian ""Traditional Vegetarian"" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices. 

This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.

This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14"" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market.",review,LHQ2fuC2RDS-Md_dN2O1IQ,1,1,0,13

Served with a skewer of small,  delicious Kalamata olives. This was a pleasant twist to the big, green olives. The martini was clean, smooth and perfectly balanced. Thumbs up R.J.! 

On the other hand, the Vegetarian Falafel burger that I ordered was thumbs...sideways. I've had falafel burgers and traditional fried falafel countless times before so I was stoked to see it on their menu. My experience was a disappointment in flavor and texture. The burger was completely bland and could have used a little extra texture. The burger is touted as Michael Mina's mother's recipe. So I really hate to give it a negative review. Perhaps Chef Mina should step Mom's recipe up a notch! #Just saying. 

When my server asked how my food was, I let him know that I wasn't a fan. His response was,  ""Ok, I'll let the chef know"" and sheepishly walked away. Huh!??? That's it? Our server was very pleasant and attentive, but when it came to responding to ""I don't care for my meal"" he could have done better. And frankly, if I wasn't with business associates, I would have sent the burger back. I felt that instead of simply saying ""I'll let the Chef know"" he should have asked if he could bring me something else. I accidentally skipped lunch and starving, so I ate the burger...reluctantly. 

I've been to Bourbon a few times but always just sit in the bar which I think has great ambiance. The last time I was there, me and my friend ordered classic cheeseburgers. We asked for them to be cooked medium. We got medium-well. The beef is high quality, so the taste was good and we didn't complain. But still, we ASKED for medium. The red onion rings were delish however.

Nam Sao is the best. The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet. Great service, my drink never goes empty, and the table is set in traditional pho-joint style: a metal caddy with spoons, forks [...], chopsticks, napkins, and all the delicious condiments.

But my wife and I enjoy singing and have found it difficult to find places with decent sound systems that also have a decent catalogue of music, so I deal with it.  I've been to Kobalt twice now, the first time with my wife, and last night with a group of friends.  We had a lot of fun both times.  The music selection is one of the best we've found, although the sound system can be a little ""off"".  Sometimes the feedback can get a little strong on the wireless microphones.  I guess we're just spoiled by our regular karaoke haunt, and our hostess who mixes the music so you sound really good.  Here, it's just you and music baby!

I have to say, the crowd at Kobalt is really different (in a good way) than some of the other bars in town.  The patrons are very friendly, and very respectful (well, everyone except for the guy that told our friend she was built like a ""Brick Sh!thouse!""  I'm pretty sure he was just trying to tell her in his own way that she looked very lovely, which she did).  But seriously, that was a one-off and you get those in every crowd.   The bartender is really nice, very attentive, and remembered what we ordered from last week.  Huge props and huge tips!  The Karaoke host is great.  Works in new singers in a timely fashion and makes sure everyone has a good time.  

There's been a lot of talk about the smell of popcorn in previous reviews.  It's true; they have a popcorn machine by the patio door.  I've never tried it, but there's only been crumbs left when we got there both times so I guess it goes good with beer, apple martini's or whatever your choice of drink may be. I didn't find the smell overwhelming though, as some have said.

As for the catalogue, they have plenty to choose from.  You'll find a nice selection of country, rock, and of course...Showtunes!  You're almost guaranteed to hear Rent, Phantom, All that Jazz and plenty of old standards by Sinatra and the rest of the Pack.  FTW!

It was a little difficult to find at first, but if you drive around to the North side of the building, you can park under the structure and you'll see the sign in the breezeway.  I give Kobalt 4 out of 5 stars only because they don't have karaoke on a night when I don't have to get up early for work the next morning.

This is a store that you could spend hours and hours really looking at everything. This Antique Mall has TONS of GREAT Antique finds...like REAL antique and retro STUFF, not recent overpriced crap that most Antique Dealers throw in their booth and try to pass off as something worth a lot of money. There are things here that I haven't ever seen at other Antique stores before.

I quickly walked down the aisles, the prices seemed pretty good and yet some that seemed OVERPRICED. I wonder if Antique Dealers are wanting to sell merchandise or pay monthly rent to store their museum. Believe it or not, you can still get BETTER deals on ebay.

Several of the booths seemed like they had a theme, like stepping back into that time era... they were merchandised nicely.

The restroom even looked like some grandmother's tacky bathroom decor, it really fit in well with the antique feeling.

I will definitely come back here when I have more time to shop.

   I think Jason B.'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place. And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.
   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the ""European Standard"". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to ""pass"" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?
   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.
   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.
   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.
   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I ""second"" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)
   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.

   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.
They're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.
   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.",review,YcbKJqlmfvU1jkYN2pfotw,0,1,0,13

There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it.

Most Pei Wei's are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they aren't located in the ghetto.

As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you won't find it at Pei Wei. I don't understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isn't even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the 'fake' Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food ""manadrian style"" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, ""Ooo.. yeahh.. I'm just not sure about that."" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesn't mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant.

The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, that's a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They aren't your family. You don't know them.

Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians.",review,VNEqps27mp8-gTqTfzg7yw,0,0,1,13

The woman who runs the place.  I've forgotten her name.  She is one of the most gracious, friendly, and kind people you can ever hope to meet.
When I go there, sometimes with and some times without my wife, I alway order the small sausage sandwich.  With ajvar and onion, this can't be beat no matter how you my search around.  The sausages, cevap, are delicious and what's unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages.  Simply delicious from all points of view.  They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch.  In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant.  Their soups are do die for.
A very favorite of ours.
I give this a 5 star because in the Bosnian/Jugoslavian cuisine catagory, this can't be beaten.

This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.

When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.

Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.

I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.

After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.

Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.

We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.

Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. 

When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. 

When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.

Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.

As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable.

I took a few coworkers with me to check out the food and see if I had finally found a local Filipino eatery to curb my cravings.  Not so much.  The pancit (my favorite Filipino entree) seemed to lack flavor and/or seasoning.  I also wanted more meat and veggies - maybe that's just due to what I'm used to.  It was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor I wanted.  The good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it's very fresh and hot - just be prepared to wait a few minutes.

I was also very excited to get some lumpia.  Again, not so much.  They were tiny with some mushed ingredients in them.  Also again, it may be just what I am used to, but I've always had ones which are longer with more fillings - stuff you can actually see and taste what's in them.

On a positive note, the folks there are extremely friendly and helpful.  It makes me want to like it even more.  I'll go back and give it another go - I'll give the chicken adobo (my other favorite) a shot for some redemption.

A few tips:
*If you order pancit, order first because everyone's items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you.
*It is a small place - tough to fit the 5 of us.  There were only a few other tables to seat 2.

Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!) 

Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.

Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal. 

The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many ""salsas"" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.

Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.

Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back.",review,g13P8XfDT5Zfcts4wai4-Q,0,0,0,13

I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now, they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced.

I have always opted for the Market pizza, a dish that includes artichokes, large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough.  There hasn't been one time that I've visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order.  I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their food's ingredients, atmosphere and customer service methods.

As for salads,  If you can take the 'heat' I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad.  The chipotle dressing, black beans, rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette.  You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite.

First of all, if you haven't seen Distrito, scope the photos on the website. High-five to the interior designer. From the gold glittery tables to the gumball wall, this place screams fun, energy, and overall a kick-ass atmosphere.

I stayed at the Saguaro for five nights, so I had plenty of time to get my dinner (and breakfast!) on at Distrito. Actually, for dinner, I had room service but Distrito is where it came from. I was absolutely starving after a long plane ride, so I ordered the chicken tacos, guac, and a plantain appetizer, and it only took about 20 minutes to show up. Win.

The chicken tacos were really, really good. Little corn tortillas, marinated chicken, slaw, radish, and a perfectly-sized slice of avocado. There were three of them and I could only eat two, but they were so well made. The plantain dish was also impressive, and had some black bean puree underneath that balanced out the sweetness of the plantains. The star of the show, however, was the guacamole. Tons of lime, zing, and flavor. I ate almost all of it and it was definitely worth it. Usually when I have guacamole it's just so-so and I have to add some spice, but this showed up completely perfect.

When I had breakfast, things were also on point. They made me an egg white omelet with tons of vegetables inside, and my co-workers seemed to love other menu items like the pancakes and french toast, as well.

Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.  

Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.  

The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place. 

We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.  

I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.

I sat at the bar which is good for dining alone.  The bartender is very friendly.  I had the foie gras and the pork belly for dinner.  The foie gras was ok because the brioche was over powering with to much sweetness.  The pork belly is divine.  The meat melts in the mouth, and the butternut squash and bacon bits compliment each other very well.    The only problem is both dishes are so high in fat and I had to forgo the very popular cream bulee......

We enjoyed Digestif's Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit.

Well....it started to act a little funny. So I called up Discover Hyundai, as they are miles from my work. I spoke to Tim in the service department and he was more then helpful. 

They had to keep the car for 2 days, because they couldn't get it to do what I was telling them it was doing...but they were persistent and finally were able to duplicate my issue.

I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesn't have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we weren't even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go. 
I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays, $1 to $2 tacos can't be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3, the mahi, crunchy fish and steak. The mahi was flaky and sweet, the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion. Not greasy at all. The steak was tender and flavorful. Again though our service was sub par. We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasn't even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy. I liked Frenchy, big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place. Doorman, food runner, busser, you name it he was doing it.

Out of the three small plates we shared, she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa ($9). It was the second-best dish of the three I enjoyed.

I'd wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was ""too tired"" to have wine, so I'll have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesn't). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didn't even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard! Where's the ""puff?,"" I ask.), the butter and parsley treatment fell flat. Mom again only had one. I believe there were 6 total. Don't misunderstand- I still ate all the rest... I was hungry!! :D

Last, but not the least, came the skewer of lamb kabob (3 pcs; $9) w/ bell peppers and onions, served over cold saffron quinoa w/ cucumber sauce (served on the side).  Thankfully, the lamb pieces were savory enough not to have needed the sauce. Loved the quinoa.

Angela is as sweet as her candy is! She explained how she just started this business in October of last year; she is a self-taught, talented and creative, as authentic as it gets, chocolatier! She uses all organic ingredients, including fair-trade organic chocolate. You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose, Mudslide, Strawberry Balsamic, Lavender Lemonade, Madras Curry, Avacado Wasabi, Maple-Smoked Bacon (yeah, I KNOW!)....and like a million more! AND the best news of all, is that she says she has perfected a dairy-free recipe for truffles...I. CAN'T. WAIT! I hope I'm the first to order that batch!! Besides beautiful, flavorful truffles, she makes her own marshmallows (in various amazing flavors as well) Chocolate Bark (which is always dairy-free) and even different hot chocolate mixes. 

The most amazing thing of all is....now, get ready for this....all of this magic comes right out of her home kitchen!! THAT means, everything is made with *love* :)  So, if you happen to yelp this, like I did, the map will actually take you to her business, which is located in her house, in a neighborhood (a little confusing at first....) but it IS LEGIT!

However, she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market (Wednesdays) and the Tempe Farmers Market (on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays) In fact, if you go to her website, you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice...

Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking. Makes for a perfect mix! We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in. They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool. We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didn't get one complaint! We stayed at shade, the club upstairs by the pool, until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool. I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long! Shade also plays great music which we loved. Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.

I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table. Her name was Haley. She was not very responsive and didn't return my calls, emails or texts. I wanted to decorate our table but wasn't sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions. But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble. This was enough of a redemption for us.

The next time I'm itching to get my island groove on, I'll do it right.  We'll grill chicken and burgers in the back yard, put the booze in the blender, light the Tiki torches, invite 20 or 30 people over and jam to Jimmy.

I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :
O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious!

Just kidding.  Sort of.

Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.  

The bill creeps up on you.  We can't ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.  

Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously.

Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didn't have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon.

Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy.

Overall, it's not a terrible value.  And it's a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so don't even try.  Great date place.

Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:  

1) Onion Tart - it's just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice.

2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.  

Remember this:

IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DON'T ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just don't do it.

We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: 

""I don't know why it's taking so long...""
and
""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""

So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?

FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.

On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?

Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are:
1) the furrowed eyebrows
2) fuck-you facial expression
and
3) curling fists

It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.

I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.

P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached). 

P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.

I have to say i am disappointed with My Sister's Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.  

The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch). 

However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02. 

I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. 

I loved there ""on the web"" tags. I've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. 

I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size.

The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes. 

There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains.",review,fgNjgqVP5dNgQFfQLyjXyQ,0,1,0,13

I attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day. Overall, I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi, and robata grilled tidbits. The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik.
I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe.

Haus just doesn't quite measure up. The cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of Hawaiian bread you buy at wally world.

I just wrote the last part because I will be on the Yelp app, and notice that I often start my review with something that is not useful at all... which is that everyone sees when searching on their mobile phones.  So I guess you could say I'm optimizing for mobile.  Ok, now on the full review.  

Took off a star for the beans... they just weren't great.  The person with me had a taco salad, and said they didn't get a lot of meat in it... and the rice was good, but not great.  However, this was balanced by the chips and salsa (which I always eat so much of that I'm not hungry by the time the food shows up) which seemed to be made fresh, not too hot, but with plenty of flavor.  The ""hot"" sauce (hot is entirely objective here) was very good, and I used that for my chips as much as the salsa.  Didn't ask if they had anything hotter, as the true chilehead will think it's pretty mild...

I had a chicken enchelada with green sauce and a cheese with red.. and although I usually like the green better, the red here is great.

I'm embarrassed to say that I've only had a few of other things on the menu (quesadilla and other burritos), but they've all been delish!  For some reason, though, I just get my mouth set on chorizo burrito.  It's seductive.
The folks there are very nice and sincere, and they know English well enough, although I think some are working on it.  
Tip:  You can order ahead!  Especially helpful if you're going during the lunch rush, when it seems like every kid from Seton H.S. is there.  it's pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when there's a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called.    
Tip 2:  If you don't order ahead, you can place your order there and then go across the courtyard to Starbucks to grab a coffee (that probably costs more than what you got at Los Fav's) while you wait for your food, if you're so inclined.

They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it.
