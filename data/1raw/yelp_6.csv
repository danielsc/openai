This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!

It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!

As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.",review,wFweIWhv2fREZV_dYkz_1g,7,7,4,6

We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. 
I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. 
Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date!

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.
 I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.

The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) 

Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining.

The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good."" 

Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later.

As in most airports, those who are not used to recent travel REALLY hold up the security check line. I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights.

AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?

This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.

vxPPpj5jJKO8DtapF5S-NQ,2009-06-05,MMt47JTaLAmrbf4d_ATCPA,4,"Wow, not what we were expecting at all. But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a ""Dive"" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.

But after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.

Every culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!

A kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.

Now this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.

Don't expect to find the standard ""Mexican Restaurant"" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.

We had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.

We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.

To finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Crème Fraîche that was also a hit.

The owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.

As I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.

They serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.

Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?

So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. 

Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night?

The place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth. Waffles are big, maple syrup is warm and the chicken is perfectly southern fried. 

I'm afraid I have to admit that I may now be thinking of LoLo's first whenever I hear chicken and waffles. MmmMmm!",review,hcctCQy3bdZMezrUKkZLtA,0,0,0,6

The Ossobucco was the major disappointment, A beautiful Presentation that lacked flavor and was past overcooked. One of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly, but they just missed - badly!

On the plus side the Gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness! Reminded me on our neighborhood  ""little Italian lady"" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was, until now, the very best I have ever had. This version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce (calorie free for certain!).

I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.

Actually, I'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.

  It's dark inside and the decor makes it feel kinda swanky.
  The service is very friendly.
  They have lots of comfy chairs and couches for anyone to sit down.

  They have a great drink menu with a wide selection.

Minus one star because the drinks are a little on the pricey side.

I know there have been some negative reviews about the old age of the regular patrons, but honestly, when I've been there, it's been a good mix of 20-somethings to 40-somethings.

I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.  My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service.

Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.

The Service
My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.

The Food
We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.
For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.
Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.
After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  

Atmosphere
We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.

Walked here with friends and the name had changed. The wait staff saw my confusion and quickly reassured me that the name and menu had slightly changed but the food was basically the same. I had the curry fish last time and was craving it so I tried it again and yes, still absolutely delicious. Tried the calamari and crab wontons as appetizers. The calamri was solid but the crab wontons were only okay. A little too fried and in a skin that didn't feel like wonton skin. The curries that came to our table looked pretty neutral colored and the noodle dishes, instead of being on the red side or the dark brown side was also very neutral colored. Since I didn't taste those dishes, I can't legitimately penalize the restaurant but I have to admit that I hesitate to order anything else besides the fish because of their appearance. I'm still going to give this place 4 stars because of the taste of the food I ordered, the good service and the fact they had brown rice as an option. If ever I'm brave enough to stray off the path, my rating may change. But in the meantime, check this place out and order the curry fish on their specialties menu.

They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.

mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,2010-09-11,LDEj_-lmUw9ug-AQxgitQA,5,"I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. 

When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new ""parents"" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. 

To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. 

While I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? 

This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.",review,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ,8,12,3,6

YCCDMLcb7UW8G-o_HsWiiA,2009-11-23,U6JvoV0WYiNgUANabXMQsw,3,"Steak, yes, but 2 other words first come to mind when reminiscing about Modern Steak: Retail Therapy.

No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. 

Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:

 - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.

 - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. 

All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. 

Combined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.",review,l4nJ5rCyw_qaFiO0-NLhtw,2,5,2,6

If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.

While the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.

The ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.

Maybe I am just a fuddy duddy, but it seems that the clientele are cougar-like women, aged 30-50, with bleached hair and sequin tops. I expected a quiet wine bar, but instead it is more like a loud night club.

The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole ""we-wish-we-were-a-club"" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.

Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. 

Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like ""uh, I kind of want to order too""

Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating. Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud.

She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers).....

This buffet offers a large selection of food...hot entrees, made to order sushi, Mongolian BBQ, soup, fresh fruit and salad, and dessert.  I liked the fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, string beans, and this dish with tofu.  The egg drop soup was really good and the hot and sour soup was decent.  

For a Chinese buffet, they offered some quality desserts since some of their offerings probably came from Costco like the red velvet cake and cream puffs.  

Service was friendly and polite.  Our waitress did a great job with clearing our plates and offering to refill our hot tea.  (Hot tea was $1.60 per person, by the way.)

My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. 

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. 

I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern.

Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.

Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.

Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.

So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.

And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.

So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...

The Parlor is definitely The Vig's little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud. 

Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender. 

After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud. 

On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning. 

For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.

I'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!

My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I don't know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose.

Man.. I still don't know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6' tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didn't smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but it's a 3 for now until things settle down a bit.",review,MWt24-6bfv_OHLKhwMQ0Tw,10,10,10,6

My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly. 

I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.

In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger. 

The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.

The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.

My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.

I had been here several times when I used to live in Scottsdale, but that was 3+ years ago, and I must say that I think things have gone downhill here. The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didn't work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta. 

Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know. 

I sort of liked the red sangria, but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria, as it was pretty sweet and not very strong.

I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.

At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. 

Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. 

When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.

Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership.

Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more. 

Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. 

I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.

The ""Shooters"" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. 

If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey ""Chop"" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. 

The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. 

While the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.",review,lPaYMDmJbAnv_3pmZH_inw,4,5,2,6

Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.

Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic.

2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 

3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 

4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 

5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. 

Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. 

Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).

The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take.

When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadn't quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice. 

I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but it's also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and it's just your ""old fashioned"" frozen yogurt shop. I'm using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is ""old fashioned"" compared to that.

Free wi-fi at Sky Harbor... Check. Secondly, convenient economy parking is a must. Convenient economy parking at Sky Harbor... Check. Not to mention the shuttle drivers are always friendly and small talk-ready.

The TSA folks here also seem to smile and playfully banter with travelers more readily than at other airports. Perhaps this is due in part to Sky Harbor's ""America's Friendliest Airport"" marketing ploy, but in any case it's certainly something to remark about.

I doubt Phoenix will turn into any sort of true travel hub in the near future, but more non-stop international flights would certainly be welcomed. But until the demand is clearly defined we'll have to be content with a few flights to Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the lone wolf to Costa Rica.

I am very excited to see the Sky Train completed and operational with Stage One scheduled to be up and running in 2013. This will allow connections from the light rail and offer a new mode of transportation from the east economy lot to terminal 4.

I've seen previous reviews complaining about having to go back through security when changing terminals, which is actually the case in many airports throughout the world. The terminal is the secure area so whenever you leave it you naturally have to be screened again. There are a few exceptions, but the easiest way to circumvent this is to fly the same airline from point A all the way to point B. If you're connecting at Sky Harbor you should only be flying US Airways/United or Southwest so as to avoid a terminal change. If you're not flying these carriers then you're over-complicating things for yourself and you should look for different routing.

The central location of Sky Harbor makes it extremely accessible for people living in most parts of the valley, which is a huge plus considering the location of other airports outside of their corresponding metropolitan areas. All in all, there's really nothing significant to complain about Sky Harbor.

P.S. The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment, not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants, but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese (this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations) is far superior to what you're serving, then you should just end it all.

Two - you only have two people in your household so you don't really need a 20 lb bag of broccoli or a whole box of strawberries or tangerines.  Other than that it's a great place to stock up.

The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.

The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own.",review,TKUWlu6fruJ_jEUEXY6n5g,1,3,2,6

My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista -  on first an HP, then a Dell, packed me off to the Apple store a month ago and well, now I have a MacBook.

Do I love it? Not yet.  I like it, like it a lot.  I'm especially loving not having Vista issues that I had been having.  

I'm enjoying taking the one on one classes  to teach me how to use my Mac.  Each time I take a class - I've had 4 now, I have a different teacher and each one bringing a different spin to my classes.  They are nice, friendly, patient, highly knowledgeable.  They are teaching me so many cool features and applications that I can do on my Mac.  My fave so far is the translator.  I do some business in Mexico - my Spanish is limited - so in just one short month the translator has just been a god send.

The store here at the Biltmore is consistently packed with people, visiting the genius bar, taking group classes or the one on one class and making expensive purchases. I am amazed in this economy just how very busy the store is.

do not stay here! save your money! they only received one star because you have to provide a rating.  
aside from the horrible customer service, they stuck me with a 50 penalty fee when i had to change locations. that wasnt great, but whatever, the pictures do not resemble the motel. the ""game room"" is not a game room.  its a room with an atari in it.  the pool was small and dirty and if you like noise all night while you are trying to sleep, you can count on it here.  all these things, i could get over. however, the customer service the man (i cant even say gentleman) on the phone was horrible and penalty should follow. he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services.

I mean the little restaurant inside the store where the hippos line up to drown their peptides in sugar and grease. The food at any CC is outstanding fast food at an unbelievably good price. The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean.

It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot.  I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go.  Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there.  I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well.  It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that ""just unfrozen"" taste that many restaurants have. I think I would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w/ sesame sauce on their menu, but alas they do not.

I was a little surprised to see how small this restaurant is when my mom and I decided to come here for lunch (she was wanting burgers). This place reminds me of a narrow cave that happens to have a long bar with about 18 stools, six larger booths that can fit five patrons comfortably, four table tops, and three double occupancy booths. The bar is pretty cool, its lined with red lights and has eight rather large flat screen TVs you can see from the stools and the larger booths that we were seated at. I opted for the Sweet and Spicy burger ($12), thanks to Yelp, and my mom went with a plain ole cheeseburger ($11). Knowing that the burgers do not come with anything, we decided to order the sweet potato fries ($5) and both got iced teas ($2.5 each). My burger was delicious and was everything the title said it would be...sweet and spicy thanks to the sweet glazed jalapenos. I also enjoyed the crunchy, deep fried ratatouille, yum. My mom wasn't impressed with her simple cheeseburger and said she would order mine if she were to come back and we both enjoyed sharing the sweet potato fries.

Brent, our server, did a great job with suggestions and service. As lunch time got more busy and he got more tables he was always checking in with us and even put our iced teas in to-go cups. This place was, as the default Yelp display states, a-ok.  I'm glad I tried The Grind, but probably wouldn't suggest this place for lunch, but wouldn't hesitate to come back here if it is suggested by friends.

He9Dar4bk2vyeiPC7TkUgA,2011-05-21,x0x4lsz_9BT-Hjr7TrzMKA,2,"I went to Eddie's House last night with the BF and two friends for restaurant week and it was a terrible experience. First of all, I had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. This was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. Our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because I would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. TERRIBLE. He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... I can't hear. Then he said 'Oh hey, I'll be back to explain things.' Explain what? we're clearly ready! 'Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and I'll be back to take yours' (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. What's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.

 So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I don't like salmon, so I didn't try it. Then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird. 

We waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didn't try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful. 

So then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but I'll look' Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why weren't they left aside? 'Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....' 

Maybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess. 

Finally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says 'Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved.

Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good. 

I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a ""large sandwich"" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands.

I am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in true TX form).  

Last night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.

With three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.

THE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.  

The turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the ""black edges"" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.

The coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.  

We were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!

DESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.  

The banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy's?!  

Overall, we will definitely get Rudy's again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.  We can make the sides for a lot less and I am sure DD would prefer something other than the turkey for dinner.  

Yes, that's right, will be back.",review,64YY0h0ZAR2nbzxbx0IwJg,3,5,3,6

sashimi - Good, not great. Could of been a bit colder.
spicy tuna roll - better than the sashimi but not epic.
soft shell crab roll - this was actually my favourite tonite. It had the right amount of texture and flavour.
fake and bake - they must of used some sort of torch to brown the top, probably powered by lighter fluid as all I could taste was the burnt part on top. Would of been fabulous if they didn't try to set the food on fire.

Both of our meals were not nearly as good as we've had before (at the other locations).

The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking.

I was thrilled to see another local watering hole open in the neighborhood.  I frequent Arcadia Tavern and JT's often and will most likely add O.H.S.O to the rotation.  Upon entering OHSO, I remember my first impression being ""Is this place really ready to be open for business"".  I noticed a few unfinished details on the building (maybe intentionally) that left me wondering if this place decided to open overnight.

Simple said, I appreciate good service.  There was a lack of this at O.H.S.O.  We were not greeted when we walked in.  There was a group of employees talking at the host stand and I had to approach them before they recognized our group.  They quickly said it was open seating and got back to their converstaion.  We grabbed seats in a booth in the bar area.  We probably sat there for about 5 mins trying to make sense of the various colored menus strewn across the table.  As we were all very thirsty for a cold beer, we decided to finally order at the bar.  Someone eventually came by.

After some of our party left, 2 of us moved up to the bar and asked the bartender a few questions.  No one seemed to know what was going on.  Everyone appeared to be extremely busy with ""busy work"" instead of helping the patrons.  Seemed like a lack of training with the staff.  Overall, I think this place has the potential to be a cool spot and truly hope it does well.  If I could offer a few suggestions, they would be:

1.  Have a dedicated host(s) greet people at the front door.  Take a hint from Arcadia Tavern.  I have never walked in there and not been greeted by a friendly smile.
2.  Get the music in order.  If you want to a progressive/hip local brewery, you are going to have to do better than a ""killers"" album that was popular 4 years ago.
3.  You have something that people want...BEER!  It's great service and attention to detail that will keep patrons coming back.

I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The ""Mike's Way"" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.

Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.

So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.  

Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.  

Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there.",review,w1xiu0diVkPEyTH0ebmN6Q,0,3,0,6

Maintenance people fix things quick but some fixes are sub par.. My neighbor and good friend continue to have water intrusion in there home when it rains hard. They have to have their carpet padding replaced multiple times because of water coming in from under the building. I work for a property management company myself and this half fixed issue is something that I'm not impressed with. 

Also, every year they increase rent, they don't work with you on price and don't seem to care about good paying tenants (Like myself). They are too corporate and only care about the money and not the longevity of good on time paying tenancy.. The only reasons I stay is because the location and price is good, but also because I hate moving around. I anticipate that rent will continue to go up and well over what other nearing apartments properties have to offer. This would mean that I probably have only another year or two left before rents over $1000 for a two bedroom... 

One good thing is that the staff is nice and friendly but supposedly Equity Residential (managing/owning company) doesn't give their property managers enough power to work with their tenants. It's unfortunate really because I would imagine that companies would rather have long term on time paying tenants and negotiate on rental amounts and try to weed out the consistent late or non paying tenants. 

Keep in mind that no utilities are included..

Hope to see some change in Equity Residential but because of how corporate they are, I highly don't think that this will happen..",review,tFyQbNbBQEyEc9oCr1pJUg,0,1,0,6

There is something special about having time to yourself, when the only obligation you have is to check in on Yelp, leave a quick tip, and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside.

Yesterday was that day. I had stumbled across The Art of Shaving. I've been in their stores in other cities before. Of course I have...because if you look at any of my pictures, you will realize a couple things: 1. I'm vain. 2. I'm hairless.

As soon as you step foot into this store, you are in a true gentleman's club. Not the kind that will take all your dollar bills. You won't make it rain here.

This is the ultimate shaving store. Soaps, creams, blades, razors, balms, brushes, and mugs. You name it, they have it.

The staff knows what they are talking about. I explained to them that I have a very old safety razor and a brush. Both were passed down by my Grandfather who passed away when I was a teenager.

They didn't pressure me into buying ANYTHING, although I did end up leaving with some shaving cream. They even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush. I've been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creams....so the little tutorial was nice.

Also, there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves, haircuts, and men's facials.

Remember earlier when I said that ""me"" time is a perk? This is the best place to spend it if you are a dude.

If you are a woman, buy your man, or your man-friend a gift from here. This place is simply amazing.

I love walking in seeing that the guys standing in the open kitchen are roasting peppers and chopping tomatoes for their salsa bar.  A lost art most would say in a place that seems like could be your typical chain, quick fix, ""Fresh Mexican Food""...  

The two owners are buddies as the name proclaims and they are a friendly bunch.  The food though is why this place is a small gem in  the NW Valley.  The Burritoes are huge and would challenge Chipotle's size, but also put to shame the cold taste you get from Chipotle's burritoes, from ingredients sitting out cold like a Subway line...  

The Burrito Especial is really good which has big pieces of shrimp and some nice chunks of zucchini.  The steak served in their burritoes is also very impressive, nice grilled taste and definately not chewy.  
The sides are generous when you get a combo and the salsa is nice and fragrant.

The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too. Finding things is easy, and if you can't (or don't want to) the very friendly staff are there to help. It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also... so whether you are looking for: digestive health, immune support, weight loss, muscle building, herbs, beauty or whatever; they have it, and they can tell you about it! Pretty Good! 

You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff. And they can track your purchases with it should you ever (like me) loose your receipt!

What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy. I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt. Especially, since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either. I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange. Well, the clerk was so nice to me. She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money (I didn't even ask for a refund)... and I had opened one product. I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too - since it was almost a month that had passed (I really didn't think they'd take them back). Anyway, I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated, and she said, ""No problem:-)"" again! So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed. They had them and they had them on sale - cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too. 

Needless to say, I walked out of there very happy (but feeling a bit undeserving). But that is what good - EXCELLENT - customer service is all about - exceeding the customer's expectations! 

This I my new store for all of my supplements and health & wellness needs. I recommend checking them out. They seem to have everything one could ever need. Plus, they have an entire wall (and more) dedicated to muscle, weight and fitness - if that is your thing!

As a big heavy metal and hard rock fan I just had to make sure to hit up Alice Cooperstown on my recent visit to Phoenix. As I walked into this warehouse sized rock & sports mecca I was surely not disappointed.

This place is huge. There is an outdoor beer garden seating area on the side of the building and when you walk indoors you realize that this place is airplane hanger big. Rock and roll memorabilia is plastered everywhere here with a terriic amount of Alice Cooper posters, gold and platinum records, photos, paintings, guitars, and other stuff representing his Hall of Fame career plastered throughout. Even all the tables are covered in rock photos and images. Along side all of that is a mix of sports memorabilia spread throughout with flat screen tv's and large projection screens everywhere! Yeah, as you can imagine, they play some great rock music here, classic to current. This is the type of place that Hard Rock Cafe wishes it could be.

The menu here is pretty big with a mix of classic bar food, comfort food, and BBQ. Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles. We ordered a mixed BBQ platter and it was actually some pretty decent BBQ! Great ribs and tasty brisket. Alas, what caught my eye was The Big Unit. Not just a regular hot dog, but 22 inches of Vienna Beef destruction loaded with chili, onions, jalapenos, sauerkraut, relish, tomatoes, cheese sauce, shredded cheddar, and bacon, along with a bunch of crispy fries. Oh Yeah! This is the dog that Adam Richman devoured on Man vs Food! They ring a big bell whenever this is ordered. I saw a few people give up on it and take half home in a box. Not me. Now I was going to join that fat ass and do some damage here myself!

Yup, I ate that whole damn thing! Honesty, it was pretty tasty and was not too hard to finish. Just had to pace myself. Drinking a huge cup of diet Coke while doing this was not too smart as my gut felt like it was going to explode! Still, I got the whole thing down my throat bit by bit and swallowed it whole. Heh-heh-heh! I sat there in euphoric bliss of my accomplishment. Boy, did I feel like a fat slob.

On the way out we had to look around the souvenier area and picked up a few things. Had a great time here and the food was pretty good. Nice waitress and all of them here wear Alice Cooper-like eye makeup while working which adds to the fun. Menu items are fairly priced too. This part of town is empty unless a game is going on and there is a parking garage across the street, along with metered spots on the streets but after 8PM they are free. Lots of available parking.

My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed.

After attending a Coyotes game, we came over to the Yard House for a late dinner.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed but we were able to find a couch to sit on outside during our 1.5 hour wait for a table.  Yeah, that's a long time to wait for this place, but like I said it was NYE and we didn't have any later plans, so we didn't mind hanging out.  Coincidentally, you can get full bar and menu service on the couches outside and we enjoyed some drinks while happily waiting for a proper table and chairs for dinner.

The food was OK; nothing really to write home about.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert - the warm brownie with ice cream was a treat!  When we finished our meal, it was about 11:15 p.m. - definitely too late to go somewhere else to countdown to the new year.  So, we hung out.  Our waitress, Jaime, was very friendly and surprisingly attentive for how busy the restaurant was.  She gave us festive top hats, tiaras, and beads to wear to celebrate.  We were also provided with champagne for a midnight toast.   All of this was free, and there had been no cover charge to get in.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  At ten minutes to the hour, the music turned off and the volume on the TVs, which had all been switched to the big ball drop in NYC, was turned up.  Everybody in the restaurant excitedly awaited the arrival of the new year and when the clock struck 12 there was toasting and cheering.  Yeah, this may all sound very mellow, but it was a fun, relatively cheap (given that every other place had a cover charge and/or price fixe menu), safe place to bring in the new year.",review,qFZkU_iO6KjU-_5BptIu9A,0,0,0,6

Loved the music (no dated Rat Pack stuff here).  Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce I've ever had in my life!  Only got better from there: Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean!  For entrees, my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two.  One of the top meals I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac & cheese and onion jus.  I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share.  My wife couldn't stop talking about the Kobe Trio.  

But, I gotta say, the best part of the experience was the staff.  Knowledgeable just isn't enough to describe the service here.  They care about every single detail, never missing one.

How someone is going to take points for ""ambiance"" in a Chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. But, you're not going to a Chicgo style gyro eatery for ""ambiance"". You're going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is. 

The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite, and stare. Bite, and stare. 

And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent, tasty meat. I'm not a tomato fan, so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth, I'd be looking at the food I had just started to chew, but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma, I tell you. Bite, and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm....

The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.

Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table.

the buffet is odd. lots of different kinds of food. onion rings, fries, chicken nuggets with baked cheese eggplant, stuffed grape leaves, hummus. i sampled a bit of everything.

i liked the soup, very nice, i couldn't identify the spice, i don't know anything about mediterranean food. but i know what i like. i like 3 different olive dominated dishes, i wish i could cook eggplant that kept it shape this well. i liked the hot pita bread. i loved salad with big chucks of feta cheese. there where several tasty chicken dishes that were excellently seasoned with big chucks of flavorful chicken.

the american staples, probably for the kids and unadventuresome guests was bland and a bit dry, expected for a buffet, where the food sits out under lights.

advice:
group the foods by origin, not by meat, vegies, salad.
make up a route down one side of the serving table, greek, turkish, Lebanese. 
make it a learning experience, tell us which dishes use olives, what kinds of spices.

if you want people to come back teach them a little bit about the food, share the culture, don't mix chickem mcnuggets with a tasty pulled chicken dish just because they both have chicken in them. tell me why this is good food, help me learn something the cook knows about his homeland.

so i walk down one side and get a greek-turkish meal. the other side is another culture, then one side for the bland american food. as is everything was mixed up.

now, i'm going back again. with my laptop and a notepad, and hungry. i'm going to taste each dish by label- if i don't know what it is, i'm going to sit down and google it. i'm going to learn where it's from and what spices are in it. i'm going to make my own learning experience. if the owners sit down with me and explain how their food expresses their culture, i'll rate it 5 stars next time.

it's a family business, it's a huge building, it has a good talented cook(s) somewhere in the kitchen, it is good tasting food. it needs to be displayed and presented differently. it wasn't busy, a shame, industrialized food is always bland and busy.

now, if you grew up with these dishes, you can leave a review about their tastiness and authenticity. that would help.",review,gDXgcGKsS4ZTneej8-ACqQ,1,3,0,6

I wanted to get my fiancé (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style. I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to. Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices. I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park. 
The super friendly staff made everything easy for me. There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didn't want. They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person. After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom. At first  I was thinking ""here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!"", but I was all wrong!!!
We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds. I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers. I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park. 

In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow. 

Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me. I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want. So Hyde Park said ""how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set"". I was like, seriously?!! You can just do that???

In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life. They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set. This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesn't have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision. Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me!",review,2IaQQuZtbZKhOcNwYJOVuQ,0,0,0,6

I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.

When I ordered, the server suggested a ""Sexy Dirty Chai"", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink.

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. It's the door on the left if anyone was curious. 

On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon. 

I didn't know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad. 

The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because it's on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and they're large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldn't call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices."" FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I don't waste my food (it's almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind).

The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. It's like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO. 

My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that!

Overall, would I go back? Eh - I don't know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so it's similar to Vietnamese food.",review,qrX3s0BfiHQTH_gmnyysjw,0,2,1,6

We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok. 
This is a never return place for us. 
And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.

MXOdsPTLQPsQK9hUq01DWg,2009-06-18,XkswaXu20GZo2NSuhUes1A,2,"Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. 

I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.

Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. 

Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. 

Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.

Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.

Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. 

Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. 

My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. 

Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. 

Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.

So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. 

Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.

Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. 

I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing.

Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.

My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.

My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate. 

Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)

Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.

GlfwqH2dY3MKxrRirKeueg,2012-01-01,imns0qJ-9pusiVN7pCHzjQ,1,"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.

We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it ""shouldn't be long.""

30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, ""We're busy."" Apparently, on Saturdays, they're busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I don't recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years...

Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be ""two more minutes"", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my mom's account.

I asked for Jennifer's card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, ""It shouldn't be long,"" and then, ""We're busy"" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait they're likely to experience because of the queue. Or don't open on Saturdays!

As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for mom's money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK!

The only downside is there's mad crowds of people snaking their way up and down the hill. I feel for humanity sake I must pass on some words of advice. 

1) If you need to pass- Just say ""Excuse Me"" or ""On your left/right"" or, if those don't work, ""Can I pass?"" Don't frustrate yourself and huff and puff behind someone because they can't interpret your grunts. 

2) The railing sections. Yes, it's steep but if you see someone running down using the railing and trying to go fast- LET GO and let them pass. There's this thing called gravity and it will keep you firmly on this earth. Trust me you're not going to fly off into space nor topple over backwards. Then you can grab the railing and pull yourself up if that's what you need to do. 

3) I can't believe I have to mention this- DON'T FREAKIN' SMOKE on the trail. Apparently there are some who can't savor life's moments without puffing on a cigarette. But if I see you smoking as I hike this thing I will be forced to kick you in the shins. I can't help it it's what happens when I inhale second hand smoke. 

4) Your trash does not add to the ambiance. Pack out what you take in. This includes dog owners. Pick it up. Nothing will decompose because this is a desert. Just sayin' 

5) Finally, sometimes in life when we arrive to our destination and find the parking lot full one must consider finding other options. Yeah, you in the SUV waiting with the engine running for a spot at the nearest stall to the trail head. Park down the road and walk up. Ridiculous.

This Armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the Black Bear Diner, including a loft with moderately steep stairs. Like its cousin up toward Metro Center, it's an ""antique mall"" in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques, plus a smattering of ""collectibles."" This is the kind of antique mall I prefer, since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle-of-the-road budget but whimsical or retro tastes.

Like the other Armadillo, stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid-century modern, but it's not a total lock-out of swellness in favor of sweetness. Unlike the other one, there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare: things like reproduction hardware, the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs, repro tin signs, garden ornaments made from vintage dishes. This isn't my cuppa, but in context, it provides useful variety, and it fills booths (there are more empty booths here, but it's still fairly new).

A number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here, including the scrapbook store. Also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation: clean restrooms, occasional seating areas, efficient check-out, and available snacks. When you're hiking a layout this big, these things come to matter.",review,4DtBamDdmuYGozIHJN9cig,1,1,0,6

I've been in here a few times, but never when it's busy. The prices don't impress me, but I'd say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. 

One thing I'd like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If you're a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If you're a smart shopper, you'll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If you're getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably don't care.

The decor is red. It's very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. It's also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. 

With the patio door open, you're going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if you're sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. 

It's a nice bar, but I don't know that I'd single it out as a ""place to be."" I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but that's based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels I'd suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because it's conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.",review,Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg,0,0,1,6

I'd say this place gets less than 5 stars based on atmosphere. The place kind of feels like a cafeteria and the vibe from the entire patron situation is just bleh. The best part about the atmosphere was my own company and that of our server, Brandon, who was really helpful and chatty.

Also, while my roommate got the Chile Relleno, which was okay in my opinion, I had the Fuego Tacos with pernil (which apparently is pork), and they were delicious. I absolutely loved and devoured them. 

Some other key points: The drinks were very tasty and parking is very easy. We parked at a meter (which is free after 5p), and I'm told they can validate the parking ticket for the underground parking.

The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Manager's) Customer Service
The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiter's breath

The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste.

Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it.""  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelle's attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.  

However, our waiter's breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.

I ordered the deviled eggs to start these were pretty good, I would order them again.

I then ordered The Southwest sandwich. The bun was rock hard and just crumbled so I just took it off. The sandwich was supposed to come with a spicy chipotle ranch that I never got. 

I ordered a side of mac and cheese and it was cold in spots. When my server finally came to check on and acknowledge me after dropping off my food, I asked her if the kitchen could just heat it up a little. This took over ten minutes.

Without my asking they comped my $4 the price of the macaroni.

I tell her I too have some reviews on yelp.

A day or so ago we were discussing hard to find music and I brought up Nina Hagen.
The sales girl in this store was a DEAD RINGER for Nina Hagen!!!!
Flame red spikey hair and clothes right out of 1978 pure punk rock!
That took me back to the good old days for sure.
She knew the stock,was able to make excellent suggestions by asking specific questions and wasn't the least bit pushy.
She was able to attend to  several customers at the same time and created a very social atmosphere for everyone there.

It was a night in November. November 23rd in fact. I remember the date because it was my birthday. The snow birds that had started to flock from their summer homes had long since retired for the evening and the godfearing people of Phoenix had closed shop. My two lovely companions and I were looking for a place to fill our bellies. Like moths to a flame we were attracted to a dim light coming from a dark parking lot. We exited the car.

""Are you going to Mama Mia's?""

A beautiful petite girl with the kind of body men write home about stepped out of the shadows. I was going wherever she took me.

We were led through the kind of kitchen you only see in mob movies. I wasn't going to ask what they put in the sausage.

We stepped in and figured out our toppings. Trying to figure out toppings for one pizza between three people you may as well be figuring out cold fusion with a box of toothpicks and some masking tape. But with the plethora of options I felt like I had a bag of bananas in a monkey whore house and we narrowed it to basil and fresh tomato.

The pizza was exactly what a tired and famished private eye like myself needed on a night like this.

Man working  register- ""Is that a wig?""

Jetta-"" Yeah its a wig.""

We left the pizza joint as happy as a twister in a trailer park.

Jetta- ""I am so getting a weave.""

True, it is the oldest still in use, but it feels more intimate and more geared towards the spirit of seeing your team before the season starts. It's less about business and more about getting back into the swing of the things, having a few laughs on the basepads and shaking hands with the people who really live and die by their fandom. 

Most of the seats beyond 1B and #b sides are benches, another throwback, but really, there isn't a bad seat to watch a game. Get there early if you're into meeting players and getting autographs and also be prepared to wait in lines for food or drink. Even when ALL the stands are open, they are not enough to service a packed house of hungry fans.

I've been to this location maybe 3 times since moving to Phoenix (8 years ago) and must say that I usually go because a friend as a ""Pei Wei"" craving. I found the food to be ok, but I'm typically one who doesn't like spicy food as I find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor. I wasn't too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice. I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day. Portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either. Service was disappointing as our food took about 10 minutes to come, but I must say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup. I'd give it 4 stars if after a handful of experiences I had Pei-Wei on my ""must have"" list but with Pita Jungle, Sack's , Subway, Rubio's, etc. nearby, the competition for ""fast casual"" is stiff and Pei Wei just doesn't cut it for me unless I really had a craving for Asian food that day.",review,1lSFhUewKa22FwhXuVgFdw,0,1,0,6

She thought of it and I bought it... so off we went after work on Monday night to Los Teyes de la Torta for some Torta goodness. The only Torta I've had prior is at Gallo Blanco. and they Ribeye there is delicious but here we were at Los Reyes and the menu was huuugggge! Sara V. was hungry so we started with an app, the chicharron quesadilla estilo del rey which is with queso, pico, onions, and jalapenos. I got horchata as a drink, and Sara V. got mango juice. Felt tropical and I guess it went with the feeling of mugginess outside. Anywho, the quesadilla was big, and really a meal in itself. For our entrees we decided to split two tortas, they were the Arizona Torta  and the Mexicana Torta - steak, sauteed onions, jalapenos. They were both big in its own right, half a torta is filling on its own. 

Sum up our experience, the tortas are really good, altho i can always pass up the Mexicana and try something else. The horchata was alright, nothing phenomenal unlike La Condesa which has a very interesting and really yummy Horchata. Not a big fan of Mexican mangoes coz personally I don't think that they're sweet, Filipino mangoes are still Queen! The quesadilla was yummy, liked it very much.

Food: 
Dinner: There's these dishes that are on sale right now for less than $10 and most of them are clay pot dishes (which are DELICIOUS!). All the dinner items we ordered were AMAZING! Especially the green beans! Those were flavored and stir fried to perfection! I've had this dish many times at many different places and this was by far the BEST green bean dish I've ever had! The clay pots were ALL amazing! Everything tasted SOOO GOOD! 

Dim sum: Not enough dim sum items and the ones that did show up were only ok. We were sitting around for a really long time and nothing would come. When the ladies did come by with the carts, they would not even try to sell us anything. We had to be all proactive and ask everyone what's in the carts. Even when we did that, the ladies would just say ""nothing new"" and push the cart away. We had to order things from the kitchen but even those things would take forever to come. A few of the dim sum dishes we ordered came AFTER we asked for our check and paid already. 

Service: 
Dinner: Great service! No complaints there!
Dim sum: REALLY SLOW...why was there no food??? 

Ambiance: 
This restaurant is in the middle of a food court of a shopping plaza. They just put up dividers to section off the ""restaurant"" from the rest of the food court. I was hesitant to eat at this place, but I'm glad I did because dinner was amazing! Dim sum...that's a different story. If you get over the fact that you are really sitting in the middle of a food court, then it's not so bad. 

Price: 
Both dinner and dim sum items were pretty cheap.

Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently ""comfort food"" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste. 

My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food. 

Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being. 

I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.

I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the ""vip opening."" c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it.",review,JgDkCER12uiv4lbpmkZ9VA,3,7,2,6

A Pasty is basically a turnover; at Cornish Pasty Company, it is a very big turnover.  One is a meal.  Here they precook them until they are almost done, then finish them when you order.  This process introduces a drying effect that detracts from the product.  They do serve a sauce with each pasty, and as the sauces we tried were quite good, you can use the sauce to counteract the dryness. When all is said and done, the pastys are tasty.  But not knock-your-socks-off great.

The atmosphere at Cornish Pasty Company is cramped and noisy.  It seems more like a college hangout than a restaurant, and this is not surprising because it is a college hangout, but one where the quality of the food has attracted a wider clientele.  If you like this kind of atmosphere, you will be right at home at one of the few small tables or at the bar.  I prefer the bar.

Prices are low (typically about $9 for a pasty), considering the size of the meal.

Hints:
1.  It is always crowded.  Try to come at an off hour, like 4:30 on a weekday.
2.  Skip the very average salads and the oven chips (dry, tasteless), and probably the other appetisers.  Just get a pasty.  If you are an abnormally big eater, follow it up with a dessert pasty.
3.  It is a bit hard to find.  Turn North on Hardy from University to find the Cornish Pasty Company in a small shopping center hidden by a large gas station.",review,6qL7A04QNfLAj5Tkig34YQ,0,0,0,6

We walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.

The menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.

We ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. 

Our tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.

To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!",review,TQKPQR8csbXmC-_-2XB0PA,0,0,0,6

You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.

It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.

If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.

And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's.",review,hDlSSyDreM9xY4yQWPm54w,3,4,3,6

I didnt like much else about a place even though I have been wanting to try for some time. It was cold and rainy today and I really wanted some comfort food just as I was passing BE BBQ. So I stopped in and sat at the bar. From the moment I walked in and sat down The poorly trained bartender struggled with every step. It was also very obvious that the well trained staff was frustrated with him to no end. The Bartender knocked a plate of food out of one servers hand a the entrence to the kitchen, he couldnt settle a check with special instruction twice, and his amaturish drink pouring skills shined bright on this cold and cloudy day.
OK Yelpers I admit Im a 20 years restaurant veteran and maybe thats why I was so stressed out watching the goings on but he things I was seeing was like a train wreck! but I just couldnt help but watch.
On to the food, I had extreemly high expectaions about the food and I even expected the prices to be on the Scottsdale side of high. What I wasnt expecting was the tiny BBQ Brisket sandwich, and I mean like 3 bites tiny.The BBQ Sauce was so heavy with chili powder and with almost no vinager  it was gritty. The fries served with the ""sadwich"" were also covered with tons of chili powder. The meat itself was tender and flavorfull and well smoked, but I was surprised that it was a cold, that was a turn off, but not as much as the small chintzy portion.

Unfortunately, I never looked up.  As a result, I didn't have enough sauce.  In my case, that was a good thing because the sauce I did have tasted like crap, so more of the same would have been even crappier.

As for the ingredients, lots of choices with fresh veggies.  I have to say the meat looked unappetizing to me.  In fact, I had to ask my husband what the hell it was.  I guess it's a good thing you don't see piles of freshly sliced meat, else it might not be so fresh after all.  But in its frozen to minus 500 degrees F state, I found I opted for more veggies.

It's like it's trying to be Binkley's, and it's not even in the same ballpark.

We were there on a THU night, and the place was dead.  Still, it seemed to take 30 minutes between courses.  Which is fine, if you have some bread or amuse bouche between.  Which you don't at Posh.  So, you eat your tasting portion in 4 minutes, then you sit there for another 26.  By the time the 3rd course came of our 5th course meal at hour one and a half, we were all tired, bored, and no longer hungry.  We ended up asking our last course to be wrapped, as we were that turned off.

What really disturbed me on the food, however, was the foie gras.  An extra $15 supplement - which is fine, as I think it's always worth it for great foie gras.  We were presented a plate with nice size piece of foie gras, in a fruit coulis, and what looked like a nice brulee crust on one side.  It looked amazing.  And was, if I stopped at eye appeal.  Unfortunately, Chef decided to go way off the grid, and serve it COLD.  I'm not talking room temp, I'm talking refrigerator cold.  If you are a foie gras fan, then you know this is like eating a square of lard.  It was impalitable.  Imagine being served a lump of shortening on a plate, because this is what cold foie gras tastes like.  

I like the surprise aspect of the courses, and I like the fact you can tell them what you like and don't like to start, but ultimately, I see now why it's best to know exactly what you're getting in advance.  

It took me about 10 minutes to figure out why the whole concept of Posh fails.  The dining experience starts when you're wowed by a menu, and sit in anticipation of what you've ordered.  When you have no expectations, it's hard to get excited.  By the time the plate is dropped and the server is telling you how your fluke is in a mascerated lima bean sauce with a marigold flower garnish and buttermilk glaze, you're not really into the ingredients, and just want to eat.  I had to ask my server to repeat every course I was served at least twice - lol.

Perhaps if I hadn't been spoiled by Binkley's, that has an expansive menu that changes daily, and you pick from 4-7 courses BUT you are given about 6-8 amuse bouche (and bread which is served French style with choices) between courses, I suppose I would have been more impressed with Posh.

1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens
2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of 
3.  Timing of Kitchen; if a table has two or more persons, food should come out at the same time or around the same time.  Especially when they are not sharing.
4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio.
5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered.

Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else.
I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.  If you are not, you should wait til the staff is well trained.   I believe the owner or chef is inexperience.  Hopefully, it will improve...
