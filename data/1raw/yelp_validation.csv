"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.

In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!

We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",5
"Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.

The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.

The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!",5
Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.,5
"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!

Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are ""seasoned"" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.

My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.

It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.",3
"This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.

The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!

Anyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!",4
"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. 
I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. 
Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!",5
"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.

That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.

I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.",5
"Very clean and well thought out floor plans, nice to have a friendly staff with smiling faces. Best Target I have been to in a while.",4
"my son really enjoys islands, great food, casual kid freindly atmoshpere we go here quite a lot and seem to keep coming back",4
"Everything was nice. The ice cream was delicious, no overwhelming alcohol taste & an interesting variety of flavors. Service was fine, place was clean. I'll go back, but only because I have a killer sweet tooth and they're in the neighborhood.",3
"Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.  

Did you catch that?

DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!",5
"This would most certainly be ""my"" coffee shop if I hadn't already established myself as a regular at another local shop. This brand-new, independent coffee shop has spent the money to look really nice (it even has a fountain inside!).

But what money can't buy is community and unfortunately this shop doesn't seem to have much of that. Granted, building community takes time and/or energy. For their sake, I really really hope it works out in the long-run.",4
"I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except ""Hold on"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked ""what do you want?"" Serious help is needed there!
 If you work in the area of ""customer service"" I think you should have some.",1
"Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said ""they try the best they can""  hmmmmmm isn't this a ""fish"" restaurant? 
They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.",1
"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.",5
"Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",4
"Great prices, great food. The staff is very friendly... I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch on a more regular basis. I had the kung pao, and the portions were incredible for the $5 I paid. 

Not mind blowing, but better than most Chinese places I've been to in the Valley.",4
"Beer...or Yoga?

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.

Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). 

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. 

Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: 

NAMASTE!",5
"Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around. 

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.
 I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.

The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) 

Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining. 

you will not be disappointed.",5
This is a little hockey dive-bar located in the Arcadia area.  TV screens hang above the bar & as you look behind the bar you can see the hockey rink and players.  Enternaining as the other review said.  I had Dunkel Hefeweisen and my girlfriend had a Corona.  Good times as a group of kids played Rock Band and sang off-key Nirvana covers.  I like this little hidden place.  Just be prepared - it's your average little bar for the average Joe guy.,4
"Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!",5
"Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.",5
"OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.
Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.",4
"After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix. 

If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.",5
This is my first time back in years. It will be my last. I was in the bar area for lunch it was almost 1hour 25 min before I could get out. Ten min before my drink order and almost as long before food order. A secound drink forget it. Guy next to me walked out.,2
"Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called ""Table side guacamole"" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" and ""Happy Birthday!"" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!",5
"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good."" 

Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later. 

Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches.",1
"Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.",1
"I have been through plenty of airports around the world and I have to say that this one is on the better end. It is easy to navigate, clean (from what I have experienced), and makes getting to and returning rental cars a breeze. 

As in most airports, those who are not used to recent travel REALLY hold up the security check line. I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights. 

A word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day. 

PLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME. An unplanned trip to the ER as a result of YOUR inconsideration should be YOUR responsibility. What do you say about that, health care providers??? 

In all my travels, this has been the only time I have been stuck behind the hairiest cat I have ever seen in my life because its owners had more baggage than humanly possible to manage. Clueless to others distress as the owners, their pet left wheezing, sneezing, itching, gasping travelers in its wake. Are you from Naperville?",3
"Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had, anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door. I'm not the only person that loves this place!",5
"Where to begin?

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. 

It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.

If you haven't gone... you're missing out.",5
"I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...

The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.",5
"Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.",1
"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out. 

Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials 

They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!",5
"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite. 

Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho.",5
"In addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $2 bloody marys are a buy. Downside: parking validation is only a discount, not a freebie. Depending on when you go the service can be slow. During a recent happy hour the barmaid herself was left to tend to all bar patrons and the patio.",3
We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!,5
"What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.

Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.

I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.",1
"Man, if these guys were trying to replicate a gringo bar in Mexico down to every last detail, then they have it absolutely nailed. Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.

Rumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.",4
"A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!",5
"I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a ""glorified Red Lobster""). 

I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food. 

The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying. 

I can't wait to come back here.",5
"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different. 

I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.

Service=slow.
Food=just tastes like salt
Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.

Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.",1
"They serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus.  

I had the tomato soup with grilled cheese.  The bread was delcious, tasted homemade.  However, there was way too much cheese, and it wasn't fully melted.  

My g/f had the eggs benedict, which looked really good.  She said it was really good, and filling.  

3 stars.  I've had better.  I've had worse.  La de da.",3
"Excellent service and food           

enjoyed live music on patio",5
"I was fairly surprised to visit Line Thai and find some decently authentic, good-tasting Thai food. I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.

Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it ""phat si iew"") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.

The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.

The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.

My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.

The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.

All in all, it was a nice experience at a reasonable price and I'll definitely make a visit next time I hang out with the 'rents.",4
"Fun Irish-pub type vibe with a great beer selection and not your typical bar food. I love the oysters on the half-shell, salads, sandwiches and fried zucchini/mushroom combo.

Casey's offers inside dining and a bar - but the expansive patio is the hang-out spot. The clientele is varied and full of regulars. People from all ages and backgrounds hang out here but it's especially popular with ASU students, staff and faculty. 

The only downside is parking can be difficult, service sometimes slow and it can become fairly crowded - especially on the weekend.",4
"I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!

Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!

Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!

So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!",5
"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...

AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?

This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.

You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.",5
"Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.

For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!

I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!",5
"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain. 


I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had ""reserved"" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. 

The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. 

The food is best described as ""home cooking"". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? 

Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars.",4
"Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. 

Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. 

The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.

Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. 

I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.

Valet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike. However, the service did bring me down a bit.",4
"My first visit was roughly two weeks ago when I got a Mediterranean pizza over lunch.  Service was friendly and prompt and the whole meal cost ~$4.

Today, I stood around waiting for help for about 5 minutes without anyone so much as saying 'hi.'  One employee looked at me several times but ultimately went back to stocking shelves each time.  I could see people in the back and the general manager talking on his cell phone.  I decided to ultimately leave rather than waste any more time.  Disappointing at best.",2
"This place is busy, but the kids love the pancakes so much food for the price.",3
"This place is wonderful! The service is amazing and food is delicious. 

I especially enjoyed the Clams Oreganato appetizer.  

The Eggplant Parm lunch special came with pasta and choice of soup or salad.  What a great deal!",4
"Probably the most overrated place in the Phoenix area. There pizza tastes way too much like their canned tomato sauce and there is always a wait to be seated. 

That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca.",3
"Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. 

About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. 
There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.
Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast",5
"OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day... 

The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course. 

Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake? 

Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.",5
"What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )",5
"I am at work today, talking to my co-worker, letting her know that I was going to Taco Bell for lunch.  She looked at me disappointed, and said ""I never want to hear that you are gaining weight again...stop eating that!""  She then told me about Sacks....I decided that I would give it a shot. (not that is was any healthier....)
I wasn't real impressed with the layout of the place, even where it was located.  It was getting busy when I walked in...and had no idea what to order.  I ended up with the Van Gogh, which was roast beef, dill, alfalfa sprouts, cheese and I subsituted the marble rye for a tomato basil bread.  The girl at the counter was really sweet and helpful at helping me pick out what I wanted.  
My sandwich was really good, and it wasn't just a normal sandwich.  I also liked the little cookie that they snuck into my bag.  And the fact that they have Stewart's root beer was a nice bonus.
The only thing that I could say that was negative is that I left there still smelling the kitchen on my coat.  And it wasn't pleasant.",4
"My wife and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5-month old, so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive. 

The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb.  Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. 

The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. 

So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen.  I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. 

Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun.  Cheers.",4
"Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties. 

Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.",5
"Was extremely psyched to try Lobby's, considering all of the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed with the results. I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce, to boot.. Thanks bro, but I don't need any secret sauce favors.",2
Great service,5
"First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.",1
"I liked the tortillas:  handmade, rich and salty.  I thought the food was decent.  I thought service was okay.  I am not new to Mexican food, I know what I want:  when I say I want cheese and cilantro and tomatillo salsa,  please give it to me.  They charged me and extra dollar for had smattering of queso fresca.  Boo.  I liked the mango-pineapple aqua, super sweet and clean flavor.  I would go back, maybe.",3
"Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle.",3
"- the location is excellent
- the food is mediocre, and milder than they advertise
- the wait staff is polite and bland.  At several opportunities, they were missing for more than 5 mins.
- the bill will be higher than anyone expects

Bottom line:  don't bother",2
"Sandbar gives us North Scottsdalers another chance at a casual bar on our side of town!  Located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, Sandbar has a pretty convenient location and is usually a fun spot to go out dancing and drinking.  The DJ is either hit or miss; sometimes he plays awesome music and everyone's on the dance floor and other times the dance floor is completely empty because the music ain't so great. 
I've always wondered if anyone has become so intoxicated while at Sandbar that they have fallen into the little pond outside. Unfortunately, I have never seen this happen.
But I have woken up in the morning with a Sandbar server schedule in my pocket with no recollection as to why.
My friend was dancing so crazy one night on one of the platforms, that when she jumped off, she sprained her ankle. 
See? Sandbar's a really good time.
Oh and if you get hungry, there's a little hot dog cart out front, so you can eat a wiener, drink and be merry.",4
"After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. 

As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)",5
"I read all the good reviews of this restaurant , and wanted to try it, as it's right up the street from where I live. I don't think I hit a bad night, it was slow, the service  was horrible, they confused our order with the table next to us.
 He  put  plates of food  down and walked off, the order had nothing to do with ours.
We tried to get his attention,gave up and took a bite.
OMG, it was AWFUL,fried fish that tasted so fishy that I couldn't eat it.
At that point, the table next to us realized it was their meal , and got up and walked out .
 Finally I got the waiters attention, he took the plates ,gave us the correct meal, and didn't offer to do anything about all of our time he had wasted, let alone the mistake. Our real meal was O.K., I tried the tamales, wasn't blown away,my boyfriend said his steak was so-so. I don't think I would come back again.",2
"Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!",5
"This place is fantastic - very tasty and a nice surprise for the Tempe area.   Tempe seems to be full of places meant for those in college (makes sense because it is, in fact, a college town) - but for those of us who work in the are this is a nice break from the regular places.  I will be adding this to my list of lunch options. 

It is really nice when you are looking for a light salad or even quiche.  I would recommend this.",4
"3 syllables for this place. 
A-MAZ-ING!

The best Phoenix has to offer.",5
"They have good baked baguettes and the price was $1.50 last month, however raising the price to $2 per roll during the holiday's is ridiculous.  The female cashier was short and unprofessional.  While i was waiting for the rolls, she was rude to the next three customers spending money.  They need to work on their customer service and I vowed never to go back.",2
"The food and service were both amazing. I've had the gyro pita, orzo and greek potatoes. All were fantastic. Try the gelato also. It's the best in town! The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer.",5
"Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.  A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me, assessed my problem, and quoted a very fair price to fix it. This guy was way too clean, personable and professional to be the plumber? He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time! You have to understand... I am use to a dirty, loud, intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt!  These guys won me over and their telephone number 623-977-4458 is in my cell phone now.  I highly recommend Palmer's Plumbing!!!",5
"I had a nice lunch here on a hot summer day. $12 for a good pastrami sandwich with crispy seasoned fries and an iced tea. Definitely recommend the food.

Line was very short on a Friday afternoon. Soda machine ran out of ice, but they filled my cup with ice from ice maker in back and quickly filled machine with more ice.",4
"I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!  

Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. ""It looks interesting"" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. 

We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night. 

I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.  

Thank you Jason and Switch.",5
"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!  

I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!",1
"I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!! 

If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.",5
"tried this place due to a restaurant.com gift certificate, 4 stars for service, we had an awesome and attentive server which made it great for first visit. drinks were good. went with friends and did some sharing to try the different dishes we ordered. the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side, the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish, the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro, the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though. great salsa. would come back and try other dishes and tae in some live music.",4
"Came here for lunch recently with active Yelper and friend Brett B. I'm sure he'll post up his own review of the place.

This is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill 'er up at the fountain yourself. I wasn't sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked ""how big is the salad"" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a ""size"" with their hands and shrug and say, ""i don't know... about like this?"" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a ""mound"" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. 

When I ordered ""just water"" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, ""you know what? Just take a regular glass, it's more comfortable...."" He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor's office, when you order water.

I really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because I'll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.

The caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was ""perfect"" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful.

The cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.

Granted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, I'm spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonno's in NYC's upper east side. But still, darn good. I'd eat it again. (I took some home and it didn't look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).

Brett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious. 

And the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. 

Great food - great service - great vibe. I hope this place sticks around. 

Definitely would eat there again. Looking forward to it, even!",3
"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I don't care for.

There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before.

I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for.

Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure.",2
Our visit to Scottsdale brought us into Fountain Hills to look for a home. While we were there we decided to look at the beautiful fountain we heard so much about. That's when we happened upon this place. The pizza was fantastic!!! It made us want to move here even more. Delicious!,4
"I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.

First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. 

The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? 

The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.",5
"A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) 

We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.

We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)

Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!

We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. 

I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. 

There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.

Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.",3
"An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.  

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.",2
"I have been coming here for the past 4 years; the pizza and food are great.  The service has been very good, some seasonal workers and some regulars.  I bring friends from out of town here for good pizza and wings.  I would recommend it any time.",4
"Just a quick review to get the ball rolling. Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker ""Modern Thai"" has become euphemism for ""Expensive Thai."" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce.",3
"My Fiance and I went here today for the first time. We shared a meat pie
and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish. 
     ALL of it was amazing. I cannot speak highly enough of their food. Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick. The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated. All over, the ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning!",5
"So, yea. Kelly's review has me more than a little concerned.  Thinking we won't go back for awhile. Most likely quite awhile.  I'd rather be sure they have that crap taken care of.  Literally.

But here's why we'll still end up going back.  It's all about 3 things.  It's conveniently located.  It makes you feel like you're eating healthy (Note - doesn't really encourage healthy eating, more just a healthy attitude.  Keeps the brownies, chocolate pudding, pizza and mayo based salads in large supply) And then finally - Coupons.  They have coupons ALL the time.  ALL the time.  

Special note - if you aren't that hungry - don't go here.  Go somewhere else where you can split your meal or take 1/2 home.  Here that 1/2 a plate of salad greens is going to cost you just as much as the guy on his 4th plate.",3
"Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order.",5
"My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.",1
"I was severely mislead by Frank A's, ""It's hot, but the food ain't bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.",1
"I didn't eat here, so I guess I can't give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for 2 bucks on Sunday evening. 
The more places that I can drink then take a bus home, the better.",4
Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!,5
"Cibo!   Eating outside is a major part of the experience even on a hot summer night in Phoenix!  Worth the dampness from head to toe.  The BONUS is sitting under the African tree with the lights and grapes with the FULL moon shining on us  ~

Our red haired waiter sporting 1950's style glasses was fun, fun, fun and pleasingly attentive.   We had white wine;  superb choice thanks to the 4 different wine tastes I received while choosing it.  

The strawberry/walnut salad was a bit dry, yet the feta was marvelous!  Great soft texture to melt in your mouth.  

The pizza was the sausage and it was wood fired, nice and perfect.  Just enough food for the 3 of us ~

So much food, just the right amount for our bellies.  For the 3 of us, the bill was only $43.00.  Not too bad on a Saturday night to go in 1/3's.

~ Luana Joya Lucia",4
"Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best

Actually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...

Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say ""you mean the one in Scottsdale"" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...",1
"Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.",5
My buddy and I (along with our dogs) stop by here every morning on the way to dog park. Hot coffee and hot women making the coffee! Love this place!,4
"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!

Drinks
1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice. 
2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.

Food
1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing.
2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.",5
"Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.",5
"A definite four stars, the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in Scottsdale Civic Center. now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit, veg and the nectar of the gods, Coffee, all packed into one nice bright orange place.  

Old Town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find.  can i say I hope to see this as a Scottsdale yelp ""hidden gem.""

As for my last meal I had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations, the fresh basil really added the extra taste.  

Service was ok, a typical cafe style, the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious, the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go.   

So many Little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one.  Don't forget for later in the night AZ 88 is just down a few steps.  

Happy breakfast,
Kevin
PS there seems to be some kind of yelp trend, does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant, does that have a yelp definition when this happens.",4
"Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations. 

We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.

The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating . 

Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .",5
"I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you don't have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Haven't eaten there but Ted's Hot Dogs is close enough that you'd be crazy not to go there after your round.",4
"I've been to Barrio twice now.  Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  

Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  

I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.

Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).

The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.

I don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner.",2
"Beware the latte. Otherwise this is a typical Circle K. Come to think of it, the latte is probably typical of Circle K as well.",3
"I adore all of Joe's restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means it's still better than most of the restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.) 
I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think I'll have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joe's establishments. 
I wasn't completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day.
That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!",3
"A definite favorite in the neighborhood.

The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive.",4
"The best gyro you will have in Arizona...
or maybe anywhere.

Love the grocery selection.
Everyone there is really nice.
And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.",5
"Great white sangria and margaritas!!!  We went for dinner, but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria. All I can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing!!!  The tortilla chips  were fresh and homemade.  The ceviche was so tasteful!",4
"I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.",5
"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself.",5
"Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!",5
"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend.",4
"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.",5
"A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.

Pros:

Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food

Good specials to keep things mixed up

Great company and service

Cons:

Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes

Pricey for some dishes

Interesting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)

the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass

Overall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.",3
"I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!! 

But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

Then, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.",4
"great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular",5
"Here's the 1. 2. 3...

1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job.
2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty.
3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno! 

We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!

4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!",1
Delish & authentic! The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2). The injera was good (not too thick/doughy). Spicy and yummy. I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony.,5
Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.,5
"My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!",1
"They're really slipping now.  With dinner, you get cole slaw - you can ""upgrade"" to soup or salad for 2.50 more.  Really?  I've never heard of cole slaw being a pre-meal before.  I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimi's.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and there's hardly any onions in it.

The prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasn't the best, but way better than the butter!  

The barbeque chicken was ok.  I've had better at diners.  They didn't really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasn't terribly dry...

I don't think I'm coming back to this one.  Nooooo..",2
"If you have dietary restrictions or are insanely health-conscious (like me), YOU MUST TRY NOURISH.

This is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons. 

First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.

The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.

p.s.  Thanks for the tour.",4
"One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!",5
"After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.  

I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).

Highlights:
Tasty drink menu
Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style
Great part of town
Sexy servers...dang

Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!",5
"La Grande Orange is great......at certain times! I used to work by there and the curbside pick-up is fantastic. Other than that? I find myself hesitating to go there now because of the atrocious parking situation. This place is an absolute zoo on the weekends and when I can't find a parking spot by the restaurant, I find myself parking in the surrounding neighborhood worrying that my car may be towed when I come out! 

Needless to say, their homemade English Muffins are amazing. I really could just survive on those happily for the rest of my life. The grape preserves on the side are fantastic as well...and I don't even like grape preserves! That, paired with their coffee, makes for one of the best breakfasts in the Valley. And, if you're splurging? Go for the salted chocolate chip cookie if they have it. It makes me happy just thinking about it. :-)

This place is great if you have a weekday morning available to come here..or an hour or two on the weekend. The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed. And that's really not how I want to start my weekend off. 

If you can....call in the order for Curbside Pick Up. That way, you can enjoy LGO without the frustration of finding the mythical parking spot, standing in a long line (albeit trendy) and searching for a table with everybody else so you don't have to eat the wonderfulness standing up.",4
Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.,1
"As a pretty devoted Fry's shopper, I have to say this is one of my least favorite locations. Unfortunately, it's the closest one to me, so I end up there often. It's almost always crowded, the layout is less than intuitive, and I've gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion. The employees are friendly enough, but it's just no comparison to other locations.

By the looks of it outside, it seems like it would be pretty large, but once you get inside it's cramped and the selections seem limited. 

I suppose this is mostly things they can't change, but it's enough to make me drive a few miles out of my way to avoid it if I have the time.",2
"The view from the top is quite amazing! I took my fiancee up here for a sunrise as part of her proposal, and she loved it!! You really can see the whole valley. As you're driving around Phoenix and have an unobstructed view to the south, you should be able to see all of the radio antennas at the top. You'd be surprised how high you are when you finally up get there. The rangers up there are friendly too. Just as some of the other reviews state though, do WATCH OUT for random bike riders, runners, and various pedestrians on your way up and in. The roads are a little narrow and there is not much room for error.",4
"I love you, Marquee Theatre. 

Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed. 
I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee. The bartenders are really friendly, the bouncers do a great job, and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal. Not to mention, the sound guys do an awesome job. 

I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there. 

The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks. 

All in all, I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time.",5
"Great drinks!!!

Good atmosphere

Fantastic food (the bbq chicken pizza is a must)

Nice people to conversate with

What is not to like?

Oh yes, the creepy guy that kept staring at me. Oh well, he will not be there next time I go...I hope :)",4
"This location has been so many different restaurants in the past few years and now there is finally a good one! It's basically a fancied-up paradise bakery with better food, bread, and condiments. Oh and better prices too. I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink, for only $10.58. The soup was great! And they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. I also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. I tried three because I like to bring the heat and because they were available.  

My only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow. Can't someone handle that? Its gross to have to move other people's dirty dishes around in order to fit yours in there. Ts seems like an easy thing to fix- someone pick up dirty dishes every couple of hours or something.",4
"We arrived at US Egg on St. Patrick's Day at 10:00 am before the A's vs. Giants Spring Training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes. Not bad to start! Promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast. The Denver Scramble is delicious! My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced, quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right!",4
"FINALMENTE!!!

Andiamo....

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES

* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.

* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.

* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...",5
"I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.  

The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday ""brown bag"" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.

Gangplank rocks.  Nuff said.

"The manager at this location is a pretentious jerk, he is condescending and immature.  I will never return to this place or recommend it.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is sophisticated but the crowd is lame and the management is even worse. Spend your evening and your money elsewhere.",2
"Scrambled eggs, toast and hashbrowns.  Simple, basic and just what you want for an early morning breakfast.  It's kind of like having breakfast in someone's kitchen.  I'd recommend starting with (and sharing) one of their cinnamon rolls.  They're big and covered with frosting!  Good stuff!",3
Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different.,3
"Very pleasant hip restaurant. Try as many Bruchetta options as you can; each order comes with 4 pieces (potentially 4 different toppings), and all the ones I got were delicious: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil.",4
"Really mixed feelings here. Met a friend here on a Thursday about 6:45. Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.

The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)

I'll try it again though. Food was OK, not great. Probably won't be a regular hangout since it's not close by to where I live and it didn't seem worth going out of the way for considering how many other beer bars/breweries there are around the city with better atmosphere.",3
"We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldi's, regardless of the location.

The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--I'm sure we'll be back to see.",2
This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.,1
Excellent burger,5
"I love German food, and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point, they had some good eats. The *only* reason I'm giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying ""seat yourself"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me.",2
"One of my earliest memories of Phoenix concerns waking up under the eucalyptus trees that used to cover most of what is now the business park and shopping center next to what I will call the ""new"" Duck. The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .

Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the ""red"" or ""white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.

And the sandwiches! Yes, try them all. Very, very good.",4
"This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!",5
"I've rented from Captain Ted many times, and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River. He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here.",5
"Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).

I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.",5
"This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.",5
"CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.",5
"Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating.",4
"Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for a milkshake when my sister was visiting from out of town. We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry.
I was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a ""hello"" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner.",3
"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!",5
"Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin' good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like ""Hello Kitty,"" ""Harajuku Lover,"" ""Shiso Horny,"" and ""Kinki Kooler"" just to name a few. My favorite was the ""Turning Japanese"" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.

Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.

In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with ""entertainment"" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? You'll want to take your business there on a daily basis.",4
"Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",2
"We have been here many times in the last 10+ years. The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had. The combination of sweet, crunchy, savory and acidic is perfect to me. Lately, I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto. The scallops are great, but the risotto just doesn't work, though I love beets and I love risotto.  I have, of course, had the mushroom stir fry, which is very good but very hearty and heavy. Soups have been excellent. The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie. But beware...it is really rich and sweet. I also enjoy the wine flights here. Most recently, I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch. Though they were the only kids there, they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers. This is still my favorite place in Old Town.",5
"I love Coldstone like no other but this place has really bad mixers.  I came in on a late afternoon weekday, no other customers to be served.  Placed my order and figured she would give it a good solid mix.  All she did was poke my brownie into my ice cream a few times, sprinkle some nuts, and called it quits.  It was sad that I had to eat all of my brownie at the beginning because it ended up all on top!",2
"Big fan of Hula's been a bunch of times, but finally was compelled to write a review.  Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in ""Hawaii-Mode"" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hula's to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.

If you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!

As far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times I've had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.  All the appetizers are great to munch on while you're enjoying your Mai Tai...all thats missing is Hawaiian music, and the sun setting over the ocean :)",4
35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.,1
"I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial ""positive sandwich""

Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.

The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. 

Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.",1
"Maybe I'm being generous, but CPK is an okay place for unique pizza. I've always enjoyed their Santa Fe pizza, but this time I thought I'd try their Greek pizza. It was o-k. Nothing special. Too many veggies, without enough meat, cheese and Tzatziki sauce to counter-balance it. 

What really bothered me was that they sat my sister and me right behind the kitchen. I don't think they should even have a table right there. I saw everything that was going on in there. Plus, I kept hearing the servers complaining to their boss about shit. One girl was saying something about another server ""not liking her."" I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. And, to top it off, it was FREEZING in there. It is never a good idea to have it soooo cold, that your patrons want to get the hell out of there to warm up!

But, besides my few complaints, it is a fine establishment, although it could definitely improve. I'm sure I'll go back again. But, maybe the next time,I'll stick with my old stand by -- the Santa Fe.",3
"I wanted to check this place out as I had got my mother in law a gift certificate for here...  It is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of Scottsdale busy city life..  The inside is very charming, like stepping into someone's home with all the good smells of cooking.  We didn't make reservations and since it was a Sunday, knew we were pushing it, especially with the after church crowds.  But as luck should have it, was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day, was great.   I had the Chicken, wild mushroom and leeks crepe..was that ever heavenly!  My husband the strawberry chicken salad, which he also enjoyed..  One thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizens...very well dressed ones...obviously part of the Scottsdale upper crust..I think we were the youngest ones in there.. Next time I'm back in Scottsdale will have to go back..",4
"Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.",5
"Not the WORST place, but nowhere NEAR the best place, I've ever been.

Went in, back in January, for a dinner around 9:30, on a rainy night with my beau. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to stop, acknowledge our existence, and take our drink order. By that time, we had decided our food order, and gave her that, too. Another 10 minutes later, we received our beverages. another 25 minutes later, we received our order, and my chili cheese fries were decidedly bland, while his hamburger was worse than McDonalds. Minus that his regular fries were actually good.

I'm pretty sure that will be my only experience at SPS's. The decorations were pretty awesome though.",2
I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.,5
"Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else.
My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price.
I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing.
This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying.",5
"The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did. 
They have a lunch menu as well.",5
"I am a little finicky with pizza. I don't think Venezia's can be beat (for Arizona pizza).. Since bitches are crazy, and make you move out of the house you practically built for them... I no longer have a Venezia's near me. I moved to Chandler with eyes scouting for what could be my new pizza joint. Fox's Den caught them quickly. I ordered a large 2 topping pizza with 10 hot wings for pick up on a Wednesday. My order was 10 bucks! Now.. this is not the best pizza ever, but it kills your major pizza chain any day. I highly recommend trying these guys.",4
"Attention margarita lovers- you MUST order the Chambord Margarita. Delicious (and dangerous) and oh so tasty!

The restaurant is always busy because it is at Fashion Square but the service is always prompt. The patio/bar area upstairs is open seating so you can usually snag a table up there even during busy times.

The cornbread they bring to your table is really yummy but sometimes you have to ask for it to make sure that they bring you some.

I have had a large variety of of things on the menu and never been disappointed. The seasonal menus they offer are great as well and i definitely recommend branching out and ordering off of that menu every once in a while.

Definitely our ""go to"" place for drinks and dinner.",4
"I tried the shrimp and chips and they were tasty.  The shrimp was a little salty, but with the dipping sauce they tasted fine.  I liked the ""chips"" a lot.  After reading the other review I'm nervous to try the fish and chips.",3

"I'm just glad that they brought back the Strawberry ""fields"" salad.  Yummo!  Fresh greens, goat cheese, fresh strawberries, bell peppers, onions, glazed pecans, chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing! Wowwy Mowwy!  Oh, and it comes with a crusty buttery cheesy bread.  I have had a few run ins with bad waiter service, but the manager was always quick to come by our table to ask if anything else was needed.  As long as I get what I ordered and I dont have to poke around their tables to make ""eye contact"" with my server I'm ok.  They know they will get a mideocre tip if their service is so-so.  It's on them.  My mother got a red velvet cupcake on the house for her birthday! That was nice.",4

"Wow.

Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... 

I know where I'm going tonight.",5
"Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business! 

Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for. 

I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!",5
"I dabble in vegetarianism/veganism here and there, and this place is awesome.  This is a great restaurant for people who are not vegans/vegetarians and want to try it, or think vegan food is ""weird"" (in the words of a friend).  Everything here is flavored so well, and the dishes are delicious. I love all the apps, and have tried several of the entrees and thought they were all pretty good. They also have a fabulous selection of creative drinks. I hope this place sticks around for a long time, since it never seems to be busy when I go. The staff is very open and friendly and knowledgeable about the food, so never hesitate to ask if you're unsure about something!",4
"Uhhh...These are supposed to be carne fries? 

ASU boys think that these are the best carne fries. Me thinks not. The carne fries consist of boiled meat AND the order is wrong. It's supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat, but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream. I told some ASU boy about this, but he said that I probably had a different person making my carne fries  the wrong way. What a disappointment, but I ate everything anyway because I'm fat like that. hahha",2
Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.,5
"This would actually be another 2.5 Star experience but I went ahead and rounded it up to 3 stars since I am in a good mood.  We came here after going to Chelsea's Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress....

The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasn't horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didn't seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed.

We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh?

We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.  

I had the pasta and meatballs, which was me'h.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasn't bad but wasn't good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably won't be high on my list to return any time soon!",3
"If you love pickles you'll love Old Town whiskey. We've been here twice so far, and both times, we've been very pleased.  So far, I've only tried their pickled beets and pickled cherry tomatoes, but both were absolutely fantastic.  The Cherry Tomatoes were so sweet and sour, they paired perfectly with the ricotta, olive tapenade and Crustini they were served with.  This place is a gold mine if you're a whiskey drinker, my hottie loves some good whiskey and was really impressed with their selection... not to mention he said the burger was probably the best he'd had.  I can't wait to get a taste of their Veggie burger, but I haven't gone hungry enough yet... Next time for sure!  We went for Happy Hour this past Friday, and they had a lovely Agave Fizz cocktail on special, very refreshing.  Their Happy hour is progressive, meaning that everything is $5 from 5-6, $6 from 6-7, and it runs every day.",4
"The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.

I still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.",2
"I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.",5
This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.,3
"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints.",3
"The food here is amazing! So full of flavor, not fat. Healthy, and delicious!  Prices in the 10 range for a salad, and 20 range for an entree'.  The resturant is very loud, because they are always busy. The chairs are too small for my hips, making it uncomfortable to stay very long.  Oh well. I suppose they expect, if you eat here, you must be a size 6.",4
"Evil Place!!!

That's right.. I walked in there and I couldnt believe it.  The people were nice to me, asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day, i had a new kitten!

All joking aisde, I love this place.  I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores, but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart.  The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out.

To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing.  The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food, they remembered which kitten we got.  Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted.  

You want good service and a great place for your pets.. Petsmart is the best!",5
"I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!

The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!",5
"LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot.",5
"The facility is a bit dated, but the service is great.  Dr. Rios is patient and thorough, and his staff are friendly and efficient.  Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.  Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?  They're great.",5
"Nice restaurant and hookah lounge.  The service is...as it is in every Middle Eastern restaurant I've been to-t's not bad, but not good; if you ask for something they take care of you, but otherwise they do the bare minimum.  Nice people, though.  I had the best falafel EVER the other day when I ate some late lunch at the restaurant.  The market has a nice selection of hookahs, shisha, and accessories.  I'll be back, for sure.",4
Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.  Amazing service and warranty on tires.  Thank you!,5
"The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.

The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.",5
"Out of all of the Flo's locations, this is the one I've frequented the most over the past 3 years of living in the Valley.  I've seen the menu change here and there, but I have to say, I've never had a bad meal at Flo's.

I met my friend Melanie H for dinner this evening and we really enjoyed our meal... we had great service - our waters stayed filled throughout the time we were there, and our food was served promptly. Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.

Note to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!

Fortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.  The bill didn't break the bank either.  See you again soon, Flo!",4
"I went for lunch with a large group and the place was pleasantly empty. The decor is very modern and has a comfortable lounge style.

The chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.

I tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalapeño and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. 

The dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone. 

I would definately go back for the food, but I wonder if this place becomes a standing-room only drunk fest when it gets busier and later in the evening (if so, no thanks).",4
"Holy manfest '07.
I think I was one of the 20 women (not including the waitresses) in Tilted Kilt yesterday.
It was raining men.  And I liked it. 
A few minutes after entering the bar, I knew exactly why I was surrounded by a sea of men- the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes. 
Let me clarify: they did have tiny skirts on, even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out, so I guess that constitutes as clothes.
The outfits were cute, but extremely revealing, so much so that even I had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and I know the guys around me were having the same problem.
The bartenders (all men) were all pretty cute. And wearing kilts.  All I kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work.
The food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive.  You'll find the usual apps, sandwiches, tons of salads, chicken fingers, wings and so on. 
But the real highlight of Tilted Kilt for me was when I found little purse hooks underneath the bar. I thought that was awesome. 
Way to look out for the ladies Tilted Kilt.",4
"Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much.
If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day.

Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.  
 
If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.  
 
Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....",5
This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!,5
"Returned for another meal and the overall experience was excellent. Only negative was that the braised leak appetizer is now somewhat drenched in cheese.. Feels a bit ""pizza hut"".",4
"I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale. 

Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.",5
"Really cool, foodie restaurant in scottsdale. All the food was fresh and original. The service was quick and pleasant, and definitely a place to consider to eat. It's not the cheapest restaurant but worth the price. This place definitely belongs in Scottsdale as is more upscale and you could sense it from the decor and service.",4
"Could have been 4 stars... 

I went here for the first time last Friday. 

It was busy, but they don't have that many tables and there were at least 4 waitresses on that I could see. Our services was sooooooo slllllllow. Like painfully slow. We waited a long time for refills, a long time for our food, a long time for the check to come. It was really annoying. Our waitress was nice, but slow. 

Onto the food! We got an order of wings and an order of the fried zucchini. The zucchini was really good but holy hell she should have warned us that it had JUST came out of the fryer that may have been heated by lava. I popped one of those bad boys in my mouth and immediately felt the skin on the roof of my mouth start to come off. Once the burning subsided I was good to go. I hear the wings were tasty, They were really big (I just don't eat wings) 

I ordered the fish and chips. So yummy! Our friend got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus. LOVE that they offer grilled veggies as a side! I snuck a couple asparagus and they were tasty. Hubs got the ribs, it was a huge pile of meat on a plate. He loved it! 

I will for sure go back, the food was really great, I will just know not to expect quick service.",3
"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent. 

What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob.",4
"Food and atmosphere, it's excellent for me. We ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce, my husband is generally picky and only praises the American comfort foods but this time , he liked it a lot. We ordered red chicken curry and two thumbs up! I cant wait to dine in at that place again. Winner!",4
"Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets. I've loved every single flavor I've had there (peanut butter, brownie swirl, mint chip, salted butter caramel, mayan chocolate, and more). Everything is made from all natural, fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts, fresh mint leaves, etc). 

When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae, you get to pick two flavors of icecream, a sauce, and a topping. 

If you haven't been to Sweet Republic, go! If you're far from Shea & 101, find them at First Fridays downtown, farmers markets, and more.",5
This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.,5
Funny how progress sometimes catches you off guard!  My local Fry's is going through a revamp and now I have no idea where anything is. It's just momentary inconvenience- I will find my bearings again and appreciate the improvements!,4
"This is by far one of the best subways I've ever been to! 9 times out of 10, you go into subway, order a sandwich, and the employees either do a poor job of making the sandwich or they skimp on ingredients bc their bosses are cheap bastards! This Subway has a fun, laid back manager, and cheerful employees that make a BOMB sandwich every time, thus restoring my faith in Subway! They are true sandwich artists!",4
"Since I work @ a casino, I'm always checking out the others...Plus, I like to gamble!! 

This place is nice, but seemed to be lacking personality. It's new, so it's very clean, w/all new machines. The few employees I dealt with, seemed extremely bored, and a drink girl was nowhere to be found. Because this place is new, and @ the edge of the Phx. area, they don't have to try very hard, and I think it shows.",3
"I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.

I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.

The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.

Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.

The Food:

* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.
* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.
* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good
* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.
* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.
* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.

All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.",4
"Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price. The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.

I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for. I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback. I asked if they might have any additional copies. The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel. I was so thrilled to have found the books!

I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1. I won't be in town for it but if anyone is, I recommend checking it out!",5
"If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out! They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world. They have herbal, rooibos, green, black, and white teas. The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there. They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive. Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN. The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from. Hear my teapot whistling......gotta go!",5
Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.,1
"Friendly, knowlegeable, GREAT coffee, cute place where you can everything from meetings to weddings, take a yoga class, and meet great people on Monday nights for Leashes and Lattes!",4
A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.,5
"When I called to place an order last night I was put on hold briefly, however, this time my call was actually answered!!!!  When I walked in, the one girl at the desk seemed somewhat awake!!!  Keep up the good work Cantina Laredo!

My queso and guac were delicious!!!",4
"My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way. 

I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches. 

It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much. 

After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go.",5
"I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)

But. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.

Pull in and i tell the guy i want the ""Signature"" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy. 

i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).

I get pulled into the garage area for the ""spiel"" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker ""Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?"" the other guy says ""the jeep."" however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.

OK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)

the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.

but car's running great!",2
"I give up. When you can still see the dough through the sauce and the cheese and the $2.00 extra cheese, and when the manager looks at it and says ""yeah, that's extra cheese"", I won't be going back. Sorry.",2
Very average. Food was overdone and waitress stopped chomping her gum only long enough to take our order.,2
"Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the ""smart"" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!",5
"Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half.  I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store.  The staff have never complained about going an extra mile, the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials.

Special note:  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments.  Tons of specialty soaps, herbal supplements and vitamins.  Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!",5
"Excellent atmosphere, eclectic menu, and reasonable prices. Welcome to The Parlor! Pizza seems to be their specialty but the menu offers so much more. Friends swear by the duck club sandwich, and my wife loves the sausage pizza. If you visit during peak times expect a wait, but head to the bar for a drink until your table is ready. Staff is super friendly- our server forgot to deliver apps we ordered and made it right by providing free apps (equal value) for our next visit. He was apologetic and owned up to the mistake (he simply forgot to add to computer) - it happens but he handled it well. I'll be back!",4
"Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. I'm really glad something moved into this spot. It's so convenient. 

Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that. 

I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better. It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.

Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of ""wiz"" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome. 

Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. I'm a huge fan. I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave...",5
"Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at! They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office. They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses!

The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too! The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money, and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday, or so it seems!

I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts!",5
"Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'

This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food.",5
"Lame joke alert :
Okay, I think I have switched over to Switch , I am finally making a switch to Switch  whew almost over , after you try Switch you'll never switch.  And done.

Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.Lunch today was delightful. Mom and I were downtown playing around and we tried Switch for something new.  Glad we did.  

Our server Matthew was helpful, courteous and efficient. He really made the good food stand out .  For being at the peak of lunchtime it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't packed but they were well prepared for the lunchtime crowd.Food was served fast without feeling rushed. Drinks were filled promptly without hovering.


We had the Beef Galletta , a puff pastry with mushrooms, tender beef, brie , onions and a light sauce. Great size not too much but definitely filling.  Mom had chicken chop salad that looked fresh and tasty.  She really enjoyed it.   I look forward  to coming back and trying other items here.",4
"Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.  We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place.",5
"we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.  
The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!",5
"Wow, I am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place. My girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5+ years. She would probably give it 5 stars. I really like this place, the atmosphere, we always get great service. The food is really, really good and the prices aren't bad. Sometimes, very crowded, but haven't ever waited too long. We love going back and can't wait till our next visit.",4
"I've been to multiple Buca di Beppo locations in several cities.  They are a good place to go with a large group.  We went to this location with a group of nine.  The menu was typical.  We ordered the seafood trio, which was nice, and the fried mozzarella, which was also good.  The Caesar's salad was also good.  We ordered pasta entree's and chicken, all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions.  We left with a fair amount of food.  I would give the food four stars.  However, I would give the service one star.  Two in our party ordered cocktails.  Five of us ordered wine with dinner.  All drinks arrived together with our entrees.  We did not get enough dinner plates.  We did not get enough wine glasses, and had to wait for three more.  Three entrees arrived together, and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive.  We had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert.  If the service were spot on, the rating would be much higher, but, I can't justify it.",2
"Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating.",5
"Hit or miss. Pretty much the perfect definition of the ""HoHo"". 

My friend and I like to come before shows and for happy hour (super cheap draft beers and wells), the well drinks are usually a little weak but being so cheap I can't blame them.

Tuesday's are taco day and they have some pretty decent deals. Each day of the week has a ""special"" as far as food goes, it's average to below average bar food.

There are some games and shuffleboard as mentioned in previous reviews. TVs scattered all along the sitting area and a sizeable patio for the smokers.

The bartenders are the real hit or miss part of the experience. I've been here and had great service, I've returned to have sub-par service (it wasn't very busy).

All in all, if you're looking for a place to grab some cheap beers (we're talking domestics on tap) before heading into The Clubhouse or heading to somewhere else to spend the night, stop in and check it out at least once.",3
"Every time going to this Best Buy I've had a good experience. The staff is extremely helpful, but not overbearing (constantly asking and asking to help like other Best Buys). They ask once, then give you your space. When you have a question, they're always nice and prompt to answer. Perfect customer service.

It gets better though. The most recent visit to this location I had bought a camera, and even with good reviews online, and the help of the BestBuy staff, I found out the audio on the camera was terrible. Just a problem with that model camera. We didn't know.

The next day I returned the camera with its plan, and had the easiest transition with customer service too get a different camera. Within 10 minutes I was in and out with a new and better camera, and didn't spend an extra dime. It was perfect, and the new camera is great! 

Just one of the many great experiences at this Best Buy. I would give this 5 stars, but the store itself is super tiny, so selection can be limited (the only drawback).",4
"cant go wrong with a Double Double, fries, and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once, called the corporate office, they sent out some gift cards for our meals, then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You",5
"My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though.",5
"This is a pretty cool store!

I've recently found my artistic spirit through an old coworker, and I paid a visit to Utrecht one day to pickup some pastels and a sketchbook. They had all kinds of great stuff here, and the prices are very reasonable.

The staff was pretty friendly, and helpful. 

I am not an artist, and I have no idea what I am doing with any of the mediums, but I didn't feel ashamed to ask questions.

The location is a bit out of my way since I live in Scottsdale....and we found a store a little closer, Arizona Art Supply. BUT....this store is worth the drive and worth a visit.",4
"Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience.",5
"Phoenix is lacking in good Indian restaurants, and that is compounded if you're in the mood for South Indian food. Cafe Krishna is a perfect example. I would come here again on occasion only because I often crave South Indian and there are no superior alternatives. 

I ordered the sambar-vada. The vada was not as hearty or flavorful as I would ordinarily expect. It was also served somewhat lukewarm. The chutneys were mediocre. The vada was a bit too soft for my liking. Dosa is harder to screw up, so I enjoyed that a bit more, but still nothing out of this world. 

The service was poor, unprofessional and a bit chaotic. The environment and atmosphere were good. I was not impressed by the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which for me is always a bad sign for what must be the cleanliness level of the kitchen.",2
"What happened to my sunday love the Orange Table? First off I have been going to this restaurant for sunday brunch forever (they have delicious mimosa's). However recently a friend of mine and I decided to grab some quick and yummy dinner here. The portions of the appetizers they are now serving to their patrons is just sad. The brie app I so love at this place was enough for two bites per person,which i assume they thought was ok because they cut up like two apples for us. If i were interested in cut up apple for an app i would have stayed home and eaten one, not gone to a restaurant and payed $10.00. The rest of the meal was just mediocre  to say the least, for a restaurant that only serves sandwiches you would think they would be absolutely incredible. The service that night was pathetic the staff there seemed less than eager to be working for Orange table. Will not be in a hurry to get back, especially when next door AZ88 has delicious food and the staff are happy and upbeat!!",2
"If you're looking for a good meal with solid service you'll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better.",4
If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.,5

"Quality offering at a reasonable price? Check.
Burgers fresh and cooked the way they were meant be cooked? Check.
Great fries- 2 kinds no less? Check.

This is a tweener restaurant-perfect for a great casual dinner. Not too expensive. Not cheap and greasy. Just right for that one day of the week when you want something in between.

Enjoy.",4
"In today's environment of zero tolerance of drinking and driving (for millions of good reasons), its good to have a phone number programmed in your cell phone that is truly useful when you've had a little too much to drink. This ain't no 2 a.m. booty call. This is a call that gets you home safely and back to your car in the morning all for a few mere dollars that potentially saves you thousands in the long run.

Yes, you can also call a myriad of other cab companies, but the thing I love most about Execuar is the professionalism that they bring to my front door each and every time they pick me up or take me home. 

Do they make mistakes, sure. Have they left me waiting for an inexcusable amount of time before, yes. But they have done their ""fare-share"" in managing those few situations. There's damn good reason they are one of my top-five speed dials.",4
"I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning: 

The atmosphere was nice for the ""jungle"" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night. 

Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas...",1
"I have to say I was slightly surprised when I went to the State Fair this year. Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). 

We went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). 

Lines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. 

We went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.",3
"good selection, they had pretty good prices too",4
"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)

1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!

Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...

Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.

#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar

Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.


# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal

Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.

Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.


# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami

Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.

Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  


Coconut Ice Cream: Yum

Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.

Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.

I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.  

Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV

Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?",5
"So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here.",5
"I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.

They also refill propane tanks.

Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)",5
"Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I don't have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for ""sampling"" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!",5
"My darling SO just looooooves this place, supposedly because they have a BLT that comes with avocado and a half-cooked egg on it. Ummm... OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?)

I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good.

The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well.

I'll go back, so my SO can continue to get his ego stroked and his cholesterol raised, but I'm staying away from things from the grill...",2
"Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.

Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed.",2
"I really want to like MADCAP. I love the idea of playing old b-movies and some forgotten favorites. The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still.

My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.

If they showed new independent movies for $10 and old movies for $5 I think they would really have something cool going on. I hope they can figure it out because I'd really like to see the place become what it could be.",3
The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.,2
Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.,5
"OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  

Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  

You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.

  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.",1
"I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.",5
Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!,5
"If you want to feel really bad about what you're eating, you'll love Rally's...

I tried this place for lunch, after I heard about the ""Baconzilla"". I love bacon, so this burger sounded like a match made in heaven for me. The burger itself was OK, though I didn't love it. It was two patties, cheese, and about 47 slices of bacon. The bacon was the saving grace, as the burger itself was a little dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. You can also have different styles of ""loaded"" fries, I had seasoned fries with cheese and bacon. When I think about my meal there, it's amazing that I've lived long enough to write this review...

It's a quaint little place, you can either walk up and eat outside or do the drive thru, either way the food is ready pretty quick. In addition to burgers they have chicken strips and a double decker fish sandwich, so it's not all about the red meat. It's not high quality, and it's the furthest thing from good for you, but if you're in the area and you want a greasy burger, Rally's is a good place to try.",3
"Pretty good food.  The location is kind of scary, for a famous place.  i was a little disappointed in their lunch menu.  i am not a fan of paying $12 for a lunch plate.  i don't need 10 lbs of food at lunch time, but a nice $4-5 plate of food at lunch would be great.  I might return by myself, because the food is very spicy, and most people i hang out with don't like that.  it was even spicy for me and i don't mind that too much.",3
"I honestly feel a bit bad giving Wildflower a three star rating, but I'm honestly waiting for the time when I feel impressed with their food. 

I've been to Wildflower quite a few times, ordering something different each time. First time was the sweet potato and fig sandwich. Disaster. Next time with the BLT plus. Ick. Next time was Potato Soup. Eh. I don't know what my problem is, everyone raves about this place as being awesome. 

The nice thing about this location is that I can meet friends here for a mediocre lunch and walk to the movie theatre or Target afterwords.",3
"This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many ""Libras"" (Pounds) and you want them to make it ""Preparada"" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!",5
"I don't get it. Not the concept of a good vegetarian restaurant but the need to create mock this and mock that. The word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times, and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach 1 out of there, sonic boom be damned. I understand it from a  marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores I suppose. Do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing? Has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions?  I am also aware that we eat with our eyes, have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc. However, I firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies, legumes, tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel, the end result would be much better. For Example the Mexicali burger, no mock meat reference here. How about listing something as ""whatever the hell it is"" served Parmesan style? 
 
I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was in the area. Cool space, it was open colorful and inviting. A couple of organs line a small space up front. Nice mild funk flavor to the decor. Ordering is done counter style and they bring it out to you. You pretty much go behind the counter to get ice for your beverage which I thought was a bit of a weird queue. 

I ordered the spicy Thai peanut, a dish that offered mock choices, but I went with the crispy tofu. The brown rice that was the bedding here was ok, lukewarm at best. the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever.The tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned, which really dumbfounded me. I think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just off. Copious amounts of cock sauce, err... Sriracha saved it from blandsville.

I am not saying I would never return, as I tend to give places more than one chance. I love well prepared vegetarian dishes, just don't mock me.",2
"I don't know why Sunset Clothing Exchange moved from it's way bigger digs at Southern & McClintock.. but I guess they wanted to be right next door to Buffalo Exchange...

Anyway, this store is very take-or-leave it. If you are going to BE, stop by there, but I wouldn't go out of your way. I did buy 3 kick ass vintage dresses on a fluke once... and they have really cool art on the walls from local artists, including art by my bud Wiley. I think this place has good, if not great intentions - but just doesn't have the purchasing power to keep the store fully stocked/ or interesting.",2
"Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.

Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....",5
"I was really looking forward to eating here because I had read good reviews. Maybe we went on a bad day. They were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order. I got a chicken, carne asada and fish taco. The Chicken was the best. I didn't care for the carne asada or the fish. Guedos fish tacos are far superior. I don't think that we will return to Elmer's with all the great Mexican food choices in the area. Sorry.",2
"Tasty food, great deals at happy hour..",4
"A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch.",5
"I actually yelped this restaurant from my brunch table and my blackberry wouldn't post the review.  So, will try to capture the original intensity of the yelp.  I still love my blackberry and maintain it is better than iPhone, by the way!

Anyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a ""Jesus toast"" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.

So when I told my waiter I was having a ""bad toast experience"" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the ""toast"" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal"".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?

Ok, now all the anger is stirred up... I must say that My florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rate-amazing.  She truly plays from her soul and her personality shines through in her interpretations of classic songs.  I have been there since the ""toast experience"", but make my friend arrive first to look for the waiter with the ponytail!",2
"Yes, I've shopped here.  DIRTY as expected, maybe it didn't start as a Big Lots.  Service is hit and miss and usually they're great at helping.  Sometimes when asking for a reduction on damaged items, it's a good answer from a rare on the ball, positive employee.  Other times, even though it's up to the manager, the clerk is crying with a such a dirty glare that you can hear them thinking ""you cheap xxx"", that it's already reduced (on clearance).  It's still damaged so what's your beef w/wanting a little more discount?  What?  We don't need no stinkin' discount on the discount???",3
Great for young kids... tons to do and see,5
"Love the Vig Uptown's vibe, decor and oh yeah, food!  The only thing that I tried that I thought was just ok, was the Pad Tia.  The sandwiches are wonderful, would prefer large cut fries more, but I still enjoy the shoestring type.  A friend of ours, a die hard foodie, Loved the pork chop with the polenta and cherry sauce... if we had looked away for a second I'm sure she would have licked the plate!!!
All in all, the only bad experience we had was the forced valet service.  Just drives me crazy that a restaurant uses the main parking lot for ""free"" valet, when it should be for customers, and valet down to another lot.  No such thing as free... then people sneak into lots down the way to save the tip.  If this was Chicago, or New York I could see it, but not Phoenix.  But don't let that keep you away...",4
"Obsessed. Like, I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place. Please make one in Arcadia! Pleeeaaassse.",5
"I am in love with the cinema suite! Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie. The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice.
For movie that are 2+ hours long, watching movie on the recliner is the best experience. Also great place to go on a date :)",5
"Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.

Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.

And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette).",5
"Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment.",5
Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries,5
"Third stay here in two years.  It's o.k. But nothing terribly special.

Best Mexican food in phoenix... very reasonable prices...,5
"This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again.",4
"Thai Basil is just delicious! I love Thai food but i try not t drag the bf along too much since he has not yet found a Thai place that has a dish he really loves but that changes since bringing him here ! WHOOP WHOOP!   Really good and quick service for either eating in or taking to go ( we have done both). He is in love right now with their chow mein and i as always am a big fan of Pad Thai.  their pad Thai is not as spicy as other places i have been which is ok considering i can spice it up myself if necessary. only downfall for me is i am not a fan t all of their sweet and sour pork which is a big deal for me, since next to Pad Thai that is definitely a second.  

Their chicken sa tay and spring rolls are really good as well!

Cheap!",4
Who doesn't like a good carne asada burrito? No one doesn't that's who. It's rudunk,4
"INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!",5
"Came to town for work and remembered coming to Thai Elephant the last time I was in town and loving it. Walked here with friends and the name had changed. The wait staff saw my confusion and quickly reassured me that the name and menu had slightly changed but the food was basically the same. I had the curry fish last time and was craving it so I tried it again and yes, still absolutely delicious. Tried the calamari and crab wontons as appetizers. The calamri was solid but the crab wontons were only okay. A little too fried and in a skin that didn't feel like wonton skin. The curries that came to our table looked pretty neutral colored and the noodle dishes, instead of being on the red side or the dark brown side was also very neutral colored. Since I didn't taste those dishes, I can't legitimately penalize the restaurant but I have to admit that I hesitate to order anything else besides the fish because of their appearance. I'm still going to give this place 4 stars because of the taste of the food I ordered, the good service and the fact they had brown rice as an option. If ever I'm brave enough to stray off the path, my rating may change. But in the meantime, check this place out and order the curry fish on their specialties menu. I ordered it level 4 - hot and it was just the right amount of heat.",4
"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.  
As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.
 
Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    
 
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.
 
Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!
 
So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy. 
 
We all win.",4
"GET. THE. CIDER. Just do it. I'm a huge cider fan and this is the best I've ever had. Not syrupy sweet, and nice and cloudy so you know that it's been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction. Their master brewer also brews all of their sodas. Grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best. My favorite is the vanilla. The staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if they're not busy. 

The sandwiches are quite tasty as well. I've had the Mario's Monster Mill-wich, and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the French dip. All have been really good, but if you don't like a lot of feta on your sandwich I would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on (Mario's)! I love it so it was no problem for me.",5
"NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list.",5
"Great tasting frozen yogurt, excellent customer service, very clean inside. Healthy choice for a sweet treat.",5
"Sky Harbor is one poor gateway to the city of Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun.  It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.

Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.
.  
To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.

The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.

Get going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.",2
"Bring an extra sleeve of balls when you play here for all the water hazards! 

I showed up today (Sunday) and was a little thrown off by all the people at the bag drop wearing football jerseys. Especially when the people wearing jerseys were the ones grabbing my clubs and putting them in a cart. Thought I was at Buffalo Wild Wings! 

I thought this was a very nice course but the reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it just didn't have that top notch feel that other Troon managed properties have. The greens were very inconsistent; some really fast, some really slow, and some were bumpy. The grass on gold was extremely long and it was very easy to lose your ball in the rough because the grass was so deep. Blue was cut much better but I had a couple complaints with holes 7 and 9. If you're playing the blue course in the late afternoon, you might as well close your eyes while teeing off at 7 and 9 because the architect made the course so you look directly into the sun. 

I sneaked on today for $44 bucks and was very satisfied with what I got for the price. If I didn't live 15 miles away, and could always get on for $40 I'd probably golf here a lot more. If the green fees are above $50, I just couldn't justify it with all the other nice options around the valley. 

On a final note, I was EXTREMELY impressed by the staff and how friendly they were. I was not only asked how my round of golf went, I was also told how glad they were that I came out, and finally that they really hope to see me again. Definitely don't get that kind of service too often!",4
"I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit, met a chick, she took a credit card in her name, he didn't pay her back, she's shocked, now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said ""what planet are you from?""...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says ""Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy"".

LMAO!

Culver's, by way of the Dairy State, has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our ""date night"". Thought it was a cute, innocent, 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know, kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please, I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!

Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick, icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd, fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.

Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?

We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds. 

I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff.",3
"I can't say enough good things about this place. 

Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.

But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.

The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.",5
"This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.

It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. 

The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.",5
So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!,5
Good & fast food. Prices are fair. They charge a fee for Bank cards.,4
"A yummy-in my tummy cozy spot! I met a friend for lunch here and was pleasantly surprised. The food is full of flavor and very reasonable. They give you huge portions, and the service is very friendly. I got a salad and the caprese bruchetta. What a perfect combo! The bold garlic taste of the bruschetta, washed down by a light salad. My salad had the perfect amount of dressing. I wish we had this place in So Cal, I would definitely come more often!",4
Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  What's the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.,1
"I went to the one in Mesa on Baseline. I loved the vibe, service, and decor. They have witty jokes on the walls and the whole place makes you feel like you are at a party on the beach. We ordered the carne asada burrito and the mushroom burger and the sweet potato fries. We got the dessert pear and blackberry lemonades. You get 1 free refill so we tried the blood orange and the guava flavors after. Everything tasted great. I would def go back and get the mushroom burger. The prices are super cheap and the portions are huge.",4
"I was not a believer, but one of my friends said I would not be disappointed so I gave it a shot  Happy Hour in the bar is $5 a person per section ($5 cheese, $5 chocolate, $4, salad, and drink specials as well).  I was super surprised, it was all really good of course, and I was FULL!!!  Also, you can have more bread and dessert for free if you have and of your cheesy or chocolatey goodness left!  Took a lot of time, I think we were there for like 2 hours but I would do it again.",4
Been to a few different locations and this one by far is the best one. The food seems better than the others.,4
"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.",2
What can I say - I love this place!  I was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so I was a bit worried going there (I'm no longer of that age group.)  Turns out I had nothing to fear!  Roosevelt is perfect for a glass of wine with the hubby or post dinner cocktails with a group of friends.  Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well.,4
"In my opinion, this is one of the best restaurants on and/or near Baseline Rd in Tempe.

Their service is great! You will be greeted from the time that you step a foot through their door. Unfortunately, per today's so-called standards this is not a very common courtesy. 

If you a first time customer or a returning customer, you can ask the person behind a counter to recommend a meal for you or you can ask for a minute or five. As a very indecisive person when it comes to choosing an item from a menu... I really, REALLY appreciate it when I do not feel rushed when it comes to making such an important decision in my overwhelmed life. :P

I haven't tried too many things from their menu because I usually stick to my favorite: Award Winning Gyro Lunch/ Dinner. A plate of delicious slices of beef and lamb, carved off the rotisserie, served with fresh toasted pita.

Lunch is served with your choice of the sides... Oh, and did I mentioned that their prices are extremely affordable! $5-$13 price range!!

So, enjoy your meal and make sure that you do get a chance to turn around as you are walking out because they WILL thank you for coming!

Kudos to you... my dear My Big Fat Greek Express owners and employees for making my oh-so-many dining experiences pleasant! I shall forever cherish thee!!",4
"Mister Softee is an all-star, he showed up on time, provided great service, and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !!",5
"Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!  

This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM!

On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.

For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time! 

NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  They'll hit on your friends!",5
So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.,5
"Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!",5
"This place confounds me...

They have an excellent beer and wine selection. As a matter of fact, their beer selection is one of the best I've seen in AZ. Tons of micro-beers and many different and unique bottles of rare Euro- brau. For the selection, to stop by and pick something up and go, this place is great. As a restaurant/Wine Bar bar, I give this place a big...Meh.

The service was terrible. Of the party of 6, everyone that ordered a glass of wine, only got one. They sat with their glasses empty for at least 30 minutes. Those of us drinking beer, just walked over to cooler and grabbed a beer. We also had an appetizer. We got the warm pretzels with gourmet mustard. It was frozen pretzels they microwaved with Honey mustard. They were still cool in the middle and a little stale. 

Maybe it was just an off night or something, I'll probably give it another shot.",3
"I may have to disagree with the majority of reviews of this restaurant. 

We came here after my parents played a round of golf. With their round they got two free steak dinner, which they raved about... not sure if it was more on the fact that they were tasty or that they were free, which today can be just as exciting. 

I ordered the Coconut Shrimp with Sweet Potato Fries, and although this is a large plate of fried concoctions, it was delicious! I could not ask for a more crispy, summer-y meal. 

There were some problems with the service, we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine. But they were very helpful in recognizing their fault and fixing the problem. 

There was karaoke playing the night we were there, which was interesting, but not the creme of the crop participants if you catch my drift. 

So if you are a  golfer and looking for a great place to go after your round, stop by.",3
"My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit.

During my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.  

The atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings.

The prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep.

The food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for.",2
I' m psycho for this place.  The sell cupcakes now! (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)  NOM NOM NOM.,5
"This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true. 

If you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion. Why? 

-Wonderful outside ""first come first served"" patio seating with fireplaces 
-Indoor/Outdoor space for the bar area 
-A sushi bar (and shockingly really good sushi. We had the mango salmon roll - delicious). 
-No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking. 
-Great service.

What hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.

Overall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant. There are way too many locally owned gems in the Valley to spend too much time here.",4
"This was a great place to go with the parents for Thanksgiving.  Dinner was served family style and it was a ton of food!  Started with a plate of 3 different bruschetta appetizers that were excellent.  Then had a choice of 2 salads, 2 meats - we had turkey that was served with a focaccia dressing and the tilapia served with a side of some of the best creamed spinach I ever had - then 2 side dishes in addition - mashed sweet potatoes and mashed garlic potatoes that were just okay - 2 pasta dishes - we had the signature Rigatoni D and the angel hair with pomodoro sauce/sausage - and 2 desserts!

It is a little pricey, but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers, I think it's worth it.  The best way to go here is with a group and do the family style menu.

I've been to other Maggiano's in Chicago and to me, they're all pretty much the same - good and plentiful food and fast friendly service.",4
"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable.",4
"This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.

Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!

I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.

The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!",5
"I went during the week with my two young children. We met a friend who also has a young child. Nice use of space. We didn't watch television, but it does have a few flat panel TVs that would be nice during football season on a weekend.  The space was child friendly - nice menu although they didn't offer crayons to kids, which they said they were in the process of incorporating.  

Menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations. I had the waffle with eggs and sausage. I ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children. It is prepared with sausage that was fantastic. The perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good. My waffle was wonderful.  Really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  My friend ordered the French Toast, which was coated in captain crunch cereal (this sounds odd, but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness) and served with her choice of bacon. She ordered the applewood smoked bacon. It was excellent. They have five different types of bacon, including one infused with jalapeno, which I will try next time. 

The service was a bit slow, but understandable given it was the first week of opening.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot!",4
"Best pizza Ive had in Arizona hands down. My best friend lives in AZ, my friends and I stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try. When I went here they were playing underground hip-hop which I am a fan of. It made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food. I highly recommend this place I live in California and this place still comes to mind. Great for college students and the fam bam.",4
"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code. 

Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito."" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights. 

I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.",1
"Great service by Angela and their Doc
First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact
Very enjoyable experience and very quick
Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away
Definitely recommend",5
"I had a good time at Monkey Pants, we celebrated a buddy leaving for basic training. I will have to go back again. And the one o'clock shirtless shot was awesome. Sorry I don't have more to report because I was drunk and don't remember much else, so that tells you it must be good.",3
"My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.  
We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back.",5
"My husband's former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasn't working.

There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husband's had a big slice of tomato. 

Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close.",4
"Met a group of people...great craft beer selection.. ordered Old World Salad w/House Dressing, excellent.. enough to feed 2-4 people..
then the Murphy pizza.. applewood smoked bacon and onions w/the thin crust, wood fired. This is an awesome pizza. The rest of the group got various  pizzas and loved everything! Our waitress was great, and took good care of us..",4
"First thing - I felt compelled to write a review because the Android and Ipad app both state that Mokis is closed. If you are doing a mobile Yelp for this place, it is most defiantly open.

Second, I decided to give them a try for an early Friday dinner, about 5 in the evening. There were a few people dining in the restaurant, and quite a few people on staff for the evening. The dining room is pretty well decorated, more so than I thought it would be, giving a faux Hawaiian feel to it. Seeing some people there at that time gave me hope for a good meal.

I asked the lady manning the counter what was good, and she took a bit of time to walk me through the menu. Emphasizing the plate lunches, I decided to try the Combo that would get me the most variety. I elected for terriyaki beef and kalua pork. I took the side of the 'potato mac' and got my meal to go.

Arriving home, my meal sat for about 5 minutes before I had it unboxed and ready to enjoy. Considering that fact, everything was in pretty good condition. The potato mac was a bit more room temperature than cold, but that was my own doing. The rice stayed warm, the pork moist and really flavorful, and the beef sweet and tender.

Having dined at a few places offering plate lunches in the past, the potato mac was probably what sold me as much as the meats on why I'll return. Potato mac's tend to have a pretty flat flavor, and when I find out how Hawaiian's garnish them, I will be excited to get some more flavor in them. But it was just the right amount of dry ... I've had many potato mac's that are just too wet, but this felt about perfect.

I'll give the fish dishes a try in the future and report on those. But I really enjoyed what I experienced and well give it a second (and probably more) pass.",4
"All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.  

***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people.",5
"I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of D&B's food. Typically if I'm here it's to have a couple beers and remind my husband how good I am at ski-ball. Overall, it's a cool vibe with many different games to play. The drinks are affordable and you can't beat the location (Tempe Marketplace.)",3
"This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG.
Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.",5
"I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there, even though the prices are higher than Safeway. Why?

-The staff rocks. Need a certain type of wine? They know where to find it. Need a spice? That's covered too. Every employee is courteous, and most importantly, SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.

-Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty, I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.

-The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.

-I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store. From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets, the choices are a plenty. Again, not cheap, but you certainly get your money's worth. Go early if you want the breakfast, they run out quick.

And you can buy good beer by the bottle! Dogfish Head rocks.",5
"Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.

I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.

Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.",5
"1st..downtown Mesa needs to get its props. They have some really good places to check out and Mango's is one of them.  Mangos is one of my favorite Mexican food stops. I love their taco salads because their tacos are homemade and soooo delish. 

I also love their 100% fruit juices, so simple and so good. You gotta get there before the lunch crowd if you want some though, they run out super fast. 

Simple, Delish, and fun.  Oh....and here's a lil inside hint, going to the bathroom there is an adventure on its own....",4
"It's really easy to write reviews about places like D'licious Dishes.  This was my second visit since Petite Fromage sadly closed.  This time, I was with my mother and wife.  We each ordered a sandwich and a side salad for about $7.00 per person.  Everything was really very good.  I honestly think I would have been satisfied with only half of the cuban sandwich that I ordered, but it was so good, I had to finish it right then and there.  My wife and I are moving into a house in the Medlock Historic District, directly behind D'licious Dishes, and we have decided to make this our standing Saturday lunch spot.  I was too full to indulge in their beautiful selection of sweets, but I will be sure to dive into that area on my next visit.",4
probably my favorite restaurant :),5
"what a great place. there were 4 of us and we all have something different. the ribs just melted off the bones. my wife had the filet and it just melted in your mouth. she had the special mashed potatoes, don't remember what they were called but she really enjoyed them.another party had salmon and it looked great. the son from OR had the meat loaf and it really left a lot to be desired. sort of dry and not much taste. The B 4 drinks were good  and near the hi end of pricing,but hey its Scottsdale. This was our first visit and it will not be our last. Just a long drive from Surprise. don't forget the corn bread and request butter. A great meal would be a large salad and the corn bread.",4
"This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I don't even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didn't come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin' good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well that's gotta be a different story!",5
"I was hella skeptical that a Phoenix fast food Mexican joint could top a Mission taqueria.  Rivas pleasantly surprised me.  I chose the two burritos with chicken meal that came with rice and beans.  Standard, but fulfilling rice and refried beans.  The burrito was a breath of fresh grilled veggies.  A warm tortilla filled with chicken, peppers and onions.  So simple and yet so mouth watering.  Best part was that the burrito was so big that I got to save the second one for my flight back to SF.  Oh, and this whole package was under $7.",4
"On the verge of just giving one star I, I figured on 2 only because I enjoyed the cool open interior of the main restaurant. As far as the food. That is one star. 
While having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried ""Tradiciones"" I would give them a try. 
I enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. 
The salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. 
I was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. 

The platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a ""mole"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! 

The only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. 

While I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.",2
"I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars... 

Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!",5
"Great product! I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find. Organic, whole, raw milk -  this certainly did the trick! We'll be going back that's for sure!",5
"I enjoyed our dinner here although I think this might be more of a happy hour destination.  We had the trio of dips which were lovely.  I had the house enchiladas with grilled chicken and that was delicious.  The rice and beans left something to be desired.  Husband had the pork green chile mac and cheese which he enjoyed but felt was underseasoned.    

I ordered the peach sangria on the recommendation of a friend but found it to be too wine-y for me.  I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for the passionfruit sangria which I enjoyed much more.  I also tried the blood orange mojito and the coconut mojito.  They were both fabulous and LARGE!  If it were up to me, I'd make them slightly less sweet but they were still fantastic nonetheless.  

We shared the macadamia nut brownie and ice cream for dessert and that was wonderful.  The brownie was sort of like the bastard child between cake and a brownie.  Denser than cake, not as dense as a brownie.  

Our server was wonderful.  Friendly, attentive, and helpful.",4
"Was out on a date yesterday, and we had worked up an appitite.  We were on the light rail, and decided to stop off on Mill to find food.  Walked down mill for a second, and found silvermine subs.  SCORE!

I had never been here before but I liked it.  Its not the fanciest place.  Simple location, good food, decent prices.  They seemed to have a good selection of hot and cold subs, with different side items and combo meals.  I got the King Bullion, and it was tasty!  I went with the small sub (5 inches) a large pop and some chips.  Food was up in no time flat.  Seems to be a college kid hang out, especially considering the location. 

Would return in a heartbeat.  Tasty, reasonably priced, and right off the light rail on Mill.",4
"Yum!  even though it is incredibly heavy and bad for you- YUM.  we got the beef and hominy stew with fry bread and the ultimate taco.  let's start with the stew- though it was just beef and hominy, the broth was so tasty and delicious.  didn't even need the fry bread on the side.  the ultimate taco was pretty awesome- we got the red beef chili and then it had refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  it definitely wasn't gourmet but it was so delicious and so cheap!  gluttonous, but worth it.  we wanted to get a dessert fry bread, but we were just way too full to even go there.",4
Great Happy Hour ! Great Food ! I work in the building and many of us wish they opened for lunch.,4
"I had never heard of this place until some friends from out of town brought us a bottle of the olive oil. So when I had out of town company visiting, we made a trip to the Olive Mill and signed up for the tour. 

The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth.

While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. 

After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. 

The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. 

The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones. Perhaps a few more hours in the oven, and they would have been better - but I don't recommend going out of your way to check this place out.",4
"I used to work near here and we got take out a lot. 

My favorites: spinach enchiladas, green corn tamale, chicken mini chimis ( they come with a green chile cream cheese dip, OMG). 

I loved their tex mex spin, not authentic Mexican, mind you, but tasty. 

I can't speak to the service, I rarely went in to pick up, even... I'm one of those crafty people who can get others to do that, lol. 

I liked it though.",4
"I don't know what I would do if this store ever closed.  It's right near our home, has an excellent selection of both wine, meats, and produce.  Note that wine is mentioned first... I can't help it!  The service is always really good too.  Everyone who works here seems like they really love their job.  The only issue I have ever had was not being able to get basil a couple of times.  I got over it.  :D",5
"Sorry, had to deduct a star because it's freakin EXPENSIVE for lawn seats. Really Glendale? You're gonna charge $13 for lawn seats? 

It's a BEAUTIFUL facility! Plenty of grass, plenty of seats, plenty of shade, and a plethora of food choices... all which perfectly align with the baseball experience.",4
"I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was God's gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was ""ehhhh"". Don't get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close. 

We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass! 

The desserts were super good though, that was the upside...",3
"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.

They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.

If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.",5
"I have never written a review, but the food at Havana Cafe was so underwhelming (and not in the least bit good) that I feel compelled to share. 
I ordered the Pollo Ajillo which, in reality, was a pile of salt with a side of chicken and rice. I opted for Arroz con Gandules instead of white rice as it has been years since I have had this tasty Puerto Rican side. The whole thing was almost inedible... I came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad!  My husband had the Pollo Cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves.  The restaurant gets an extra star for the wonderful Cafe Cubano and the extremely attentive wait staff .  I had high hopes for this place but the next time I have a craving for Cuban food, I will be heading to Sabor Cubano.",2
Very delicious food without long waits! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I look forward to going back.,5
"I'm not a big fan of this place.  I hate these ""centers"" where you have to park in a parking garage and pay to park.  I'm already paying to go the shops and restaraunts, why do I need to pay to park too?  Seems stupid and not a good way to get peopel to frequent your business.  I'd rather go to Desert Ridge, Tempe Marketplace or any other one.",2
"Excellent brunch food and great Bloody Marys! They make their own bread onsite, which is to die for! Love it. Hate the valet parking.",5
"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I don't know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).  

The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received.",4
"Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes! 

The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy! 

Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus! 

I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered. 

My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously! 

Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp! 

Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!",5
"I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me.",1
"Yeah, it's a chain and while not haute cuisine, we had a very good meal there.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great, friendly and quick service and our food was quite good.  

Not only is it a good value for the neighborhood, I thought it was downright cheap for what you get.  (It's probably roughly comparable to The Hillstone Group's Houston's or Bandera in terms of quality and service at about half the price.)  

Great salads too.

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it, but it's a very reasonable choice if you happen to be at Fashion Square.

Dinner for 2 with drinks, about fifty bucks.",4
"We've eaten at Arriba a few times now.  I really don't care for their food, and service is slow more often than not.  The first time we went we were there it took a good two hours!  And that's not because we're slow eaters.  We did stop in for happy hour last week though, and although their margaritas aren't the greatest, they're decent enough!  They ofter a 12 oz. house margarita for .99 or a 24 oz. grande for 4.99.  Why people would pay five times as much for a marg twice the size, I don't know.  We each had three .99 margs, ate the chips, salsa and bean dip and our bill came to 5.94.  $6 and I left with a full stomach and a buzz.  Nice!",2
"I've lived at Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say, they have declined greatly in the last few years.  When I first started living at my first MT property, the front office staff took the time to get to know you, knew you by name, kept abreast of any ongoing issues and were proactive about things.  

Now, they really seem to be nothing more than shills for what Mark Taylor has become, reacting to issues only when implored to do so.  Rent constantly goes up, even for those of us that have shown property loyalty years over.  Additional ""fees"" are even being added on for services that you may or may not even use -- either way you have to pay.  

The only reason that I didn't give them one star is because of the maintenance staff.  They are what the front office staff used to be.  Friendly, polite and very responsive to your problems.  They, in fact, have a pretty similar opinion of the ""front office"" folks as I do.  That is pretty telling.",2
"Great customer service, perfect dining area! This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places, the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service! (and I am picky with people who serve at restaurants!) this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat. I ordered the side ""Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni"" I highly recommend For GREAT pizza! However the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped it...but made it up by giving me Nicole's Notable Chocolate Chip cookies :)",4
"for those who like dirt track racing, this is a place to go. it's a 3/8 mile oval clay dirt track that hosts the likes of imca modifieds, super stocks, pure stocks, sw modlites, bombers, dwarfs cars, sprints, late models. 

after the races, go into the pits to meet the drivers and get an up close look at the cars. it's a good time hanging out. 

they have concessions, souvenir stand, offer free overnight camping on race nights for self contained campers only, as no services are available. 

there's something about the roar of the engines and the exhilaration of the race that keeps me going back. 

check out the website, www.canyonspeedwaypark.com for schedule, entrance fees, directions, etc. 

hope to see ya there!",4
"This place needs a face-lift, the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help. I think their sushi and other food items are alright, although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah. Its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio, but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone.",3
"Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient! 
Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES. 
I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!",5
"I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously ""cute""  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse. Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day.",1
"everything, everyone has posted about this company is true! great service, friendly people, good pricing! highly recommend!",5
"I love the Salt Cellar for being the lazy woman's go-to place for seafood.  If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.

While the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.

The ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.  The lighting for me is too yellow for me, and everything in general seems antiquated.  I remember eating here years and years ago, and it seems like they haven't changed anything about the decor since then!",4
"This place was incredible.  The staff was friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable. I don't know what it was called, but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it.  So fresh!  We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top.  Try the sake that they recommend (flown in from Japan - they are the only ones in PHX that carry it).  I'm not a sake fan but I loved it.  That's how good it was.",5
"Known as ""The Jewel of the Desert"" and the ""Grand Dame,"" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design.  The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is ""Frank and Albert's.""

Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.

When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.

So, my first experience was our dinner at ""Frank and Albert's"", formerly known as the ""Biltmore Grill.""  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their ""bloody rose"" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  

Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.  

Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.

The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...

We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.

The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.

Recommendations:
go to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.

if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.

About Ocatilla:
basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:
complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge
business center (computers, internet, printers)
Wii rentals 
pressing service and shoe shine
therapeutic turn down bath
neck and shoulder massages every thursday
personal concierge",4
If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.,1
"Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.

I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. 

By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.

The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.

I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!",5
took my wife there last week. it is a really good. the food was great and the decor was really cool and the staff was very helpful and  nice.,4
"BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ! 

No but seriously, I could eat every meal here. Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint. I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok, so you're probably saying ""with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?"" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.  

The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill. The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go. 

Love the Herb Box and can't wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.",5
"Set up a VinVillage event at this place, sight unseen, which I hosted last night. After the glowing descriptions on their website, some of the reviews here, and knowing they are located at CityNorth, I expected much better! 

Walking in, I did not get the feeling of ""upscale"" restaurant. Sports on 2 TVs blaring out over the bar and into the open dining room did nothing for the atmosphere. They had a long table pulled together for our group in the center of the room, but I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was the first to arrive. Took a few minutes, but the bartender eventually gave me a wine list/menu, answered my questions, and proceeded to get my drink. They had a good selection of wines, and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town.

A few others came in and we moved to the table, no problem transferring tabs. Seemed to take a long time between everyone (about 15 of us, though we initially expected 20) receiving their drinks and the time the first apps came out. Granted, they were complimentary (the deal I worked out for my group), and they were quite yummy - especially the spicy tuna on tempura eggplant - so once we started eating, we forgot about the wait. The pate was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread. Some were immediately addicted to the bacon-wrapped dates.

Everyone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opting for the pre-selected toppings, other customizing and adding sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was on separate checks. My burger came out not quite as rare as I would have liked, but what do you expect when the patty is only 1/2"" thick? I am not a big beef fan, anyway. Sauces were good, especially the pungent garlic parm, as were the fries.

But then, we waited for the checks...and waited...and waited. Seems the staff didn't begin trying to sort out who had what until at least HALF AN HOUR AFTER everyone had finished eating and plates had been cleared! And none clearly knew how to use the POS system. Those who had cash eventually tired of waiting and just left it on the table. Those of us with credit cards were not so lucky...and several bills had to be re-rung, as they did not include the right items. 

I had wanted to go back to try the salted caramel milkshake, but it will be a long time before I return.",2
"The only reason I'm not giving 5 is the misguided bus driver. After asking the driver if he dropped off at 'Pecos', not 1 but, 2 times, and he agreed both times, we wound up in Chanlder/Gilbert border NOT on Pecos. My mistake in thinking there was only 1 Pecos stop.  Newbie me had no idea. It was easier when our parents pinned our bus stop destination on our shirt when we were 6!

Stranded, about 8 miles away from my park n'ride, I was advised to call their help number. So, I called Customer Service who transfered me to Wanda, the dispatcher. I've never talked with someone so nice, helpful and compassionate - THIS is how customer service is supposed to be...HP, Dell, are you listening?! 

She not only tried to find me other buses to link and other routes to my stop, but in the end, tracked down a site supervisor Bob, down the road, luckily he was on a run, and took me to where I needed to go. He was so nice and understanding, I didn't feel like a total doornob. 

Tell you what, I can't think of anywhere else where their customer service was actually helpful, and hope these guys at least get a bonus, stipend or something. They went out of their way when they didn't have to. Thank you and great job - wish more people modeled your service-oriented organization!",4
"What a place!  I recently hosted a 25-person family party there, and both the food and service were impeccable.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, even with the dozen children we had in the group.  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail, helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.  The restaurant itself was spotless, from the outside patio down to the restrooms.  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.  Everyone left full and happy.  We will definitely be back!!",5
"2.5, just not enough to give it three. 

Food was just OK and they ran out of ahi tuna by 9pm! 

They have happy hour all night (pretty good specials too) but they close SO early (10pm last call on Sunday)!",2
"Oh my God, Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!

While this location has a steady customer base, I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated, unlike the other location at 92nd Street, Win! Service has always been fantastic. Quick on to seat, quick to get drinks, quick on refills, and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items. As other reviewers have stated, the Jewish sliders are amazing, but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches. Prices are a little higher, but the food is well worth the money. There is a ""bar area"" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on. 

The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme, well lit, but the acoustics aren't that great so it can get a little noisy. Bathrooms are nice and always clean. Oh, and don't forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home!",5
"My family comes here for cases of citrus every year. The navels and tangerines are delicious, and very reasonably priced. They also have lots of other interesting local products like a variety of honeys.",4
"I think there food is amazing!  However, it is a bit pricey which limits my trips there.  I love the white decor but hate how expensive the drinks are!  I ordered a Key Lime Martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass!  Come on!

Additionally, last time I was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts!  Take a shower, get dressed, put some effort in!  Save the flops for the pub!  Hopefully, it was just an off night because I really think it is a cool spot!",4
"So Chase field you get 3 stars.


Here's the problem(s) I have with the venue or CONS so to speak.

1. Cash Only almost EVERYWHERE, for a stadium named after a bank, don't you think someone would have taken finacial practice into better concern, perhaps CHASE just wants to sucker you more by making you pay their ATM fees if your not a member which I see as ""Greedy Fat Cat"" practices. 

2. No real options in regards to ""regular"" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they don't even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture. Other than that it's just another typical ""let's capitalize all we can"" with your typical crap chains (Fridays, Panda Express, etc) which I find pretty disgusting.  

3. The ""Value"" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a ""value"" at 4 dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA.


Here's the PROS.

1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 15 bucks a person, Not too shabby! 

2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is. 

3. There's a pool in the outfield, cool idea 

4. Parking is rather cheap (12 bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue.

5. Traffic control before and after games is surprisingly smooth
 

Overall 3 stars, I just think they need more originality instead of what ""Joe Sixpack"" wants while charging him Paris Hilton prices.",3
"My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.

It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said ""Ben?"" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.

I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal. 

Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote. 

FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out.",5
"A ski-lodgey pizzeria. This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit ""weird"" and ""puzzling,"" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.

Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?

DINNER:

Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered ""All Day Happy Hour,"" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their ""Half and Half."" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. 

My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. 

Overall, the food is average ""bar style"" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. 

JUST DRINKS:

Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)

As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! 

Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. 

SO WHY GO? 
Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)

If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!",4
"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong! 
Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!",5
"I purchased the introductory groupon they offered a few weeks ago, and was hesitant at first because I haven't had the greatest experiences using groupons.  I was pleasantly surprised.

I did look at some of the bad yelp reviews before going in, which made me nervous! So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.

I had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was ""impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush,"" she was ""equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl."" So she broke out the curling iron!

We made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.

The salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!

Another good tip is to plan for longer than 45 minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for 1 hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).

I will be back in January for my 25th birthday night!",4
Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!,5
"One of my lunchtime favorites -- a great bar menu under $10 (steak, shrimp, Italian sausage, etc) with good quality food and prompt service. 

Fun place to have drinks at happy hour. Plus, they have a nice traditional dining room for dinner. 

The bar area is always DARK (how it should be).",4
"YUM!

I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!",5
"I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event. In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.",5
"luckily, i've only had to take my truck in for service once and had no issues with service or quality. it is always expensive to have something auto related repaired....wish i would've paid more attention during shop class in high school, but oh well...i can't be good at EVERYTHING.

friendly staff. they called a few times to make sure i wanted them to proceed with repairs and had my truck done in a few hours.",4
AMAZING!  This is the first time I ever got what I ordered!!!!!  140 degree grande peppermint latte!  WOWZA!  YIPPEE!  Though the staff did not seemed thrilled to be there or had any sort of personality-it didn't matter because my drink was perfect:)  FYI-this was the location outside of the B security check-point.,4
Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!,5
One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :),5
"Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.:
Slow indifferent service
Mediocre food
The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater.
But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates.",1
"Like many before me, I am trying to be sure to review only the venue itself. I appreciate Gammage for what it brings to the Valley. The arts don't have a huge presence here but this theater brings a little bit of Broadway to the dry, Arizona desert. They typically line up seasons that have something for everybody which makes an evening show now and then almost impossible to resist. 

The building itself is older and does not have an elevator--meaning that anyone who has a physical disability which renders them unable to climb stairs, must buy tickets on the orchestra level. Out of the many shows I have attended here, there have been frequent issues with the sound system...disappointing when you are sitting further than 5 rows from the stage. 

However, being that this is the only stage in AZ that houses big traveling productions, I can't complain too much and will continue to be a patron here. Looking forward to the rest of this season!",4
"Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area.  Kind of a mixed result.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall, sort of hidden in one of the back corners.  Walk in thinking fast food, but turns out it's sit down.  Why does it seem all the burger and pizza joints in this area are sit down-- odd...  Anyway, I got three slices.  Quality was ok-- a bit doughy and filling, I couldn't make it through all three.  Lots of free refills was a nice touch on a 105 degree day.  Staff were really friendly, and, oh yeah-- it was cheap!   Less than 6 bucks for more pizza than I could eat and bottomless coke.  So, great value, nice service, just ok pizza, though.",3
"Canteen is my new favorite happy hour spot. You can get two orders of wonderful pork and habanero tacos, two orders of their tender ribs, an order of quite good chips and guacamole and a couple of margaritas for around twenty bucks, it's amazing. Add in the cool atmosphere and HUGE selection of tequilas(all half off during happy hour) and you have a recipe for success. Canteen is a very welcome addition to Mill Ave, and while it can get very loud, you simply cannot go wrong during happy hour.",4
"This place is great - IF YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SNOBBY ENVIRONMENT!  There are not too many places that I've been to that are more hype than anything.  But this is one of them.  When you try to go to THE PINK TACO, it's impossible to find a parking space.  Once you make your way to the front, the hostess is always too busy texting her friends than interested in helping the customer!!  If you are lucky enough to find a seat at the bar, you better have a rolex watch on or you will not be served quickly.  Either that, or you better be a Hugh Heffner spouse.  I tried the burrito and was grossed out by how rubbery it was.",2
"This trip we rented an area over centerfield to have a conference for about 250. We got in the ballpark in the early AM with the intent to stay for the game as we had a separate suite for this. 

It drizzled a bit, so the roof was open for much of the day, though temperatures we over 100. Walking around an empty ballpark makes you appreciate the size of Chase. Groundskeepers moved and massaged dirt all day as their #1 DBacks appear to be playoff bound. Who would have thought?

The catering service was excellent and finally at game time we enjoyed watching the DBacks come from behind to beat the Padres. The suites above centerfield have poor visibility because of the size of the ball park. 

Enjoyable, but get me the box seats else I can't watch baseball from the nosebleed area.",4
"This is a beautiful store. Its huge and spacious. The workers are friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong with cute, nerdy boys who help you fix things! :]",4
"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.",5
"Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now.

I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think I'll try them the next time for lunch or dinner.",3
"My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there. 

My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is.",5
"This place is excellent.  Hands down, the best tacos I've had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the ""salsa bars"" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft.

If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas.",5
"I have been going here for years.  The staff is always very pleasant, the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.  I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.  Overall, a top notch establishment.",5
"Basicly i would let anyone know i like it, never heard a wiper of a bad experience here.  

Def a fan, i work very close by and if i really need they would deliver, yeah their that nice.  
How can i put it Ladybug House of Sandwiches or Sandwich shop for short what a great place in phoenix to take care of the lunch fill with out going to Subway, (not saying i don't go there).  
When I need a real sandwich I stop in here.  

They are a lunch spot so they close early and will have specail summer time hours.  

Why ladybug house of sandwiches well, great meats choice of differnt breads and its like what I love the ladybug theme.  and just what you think of ladybugs their nice not pests, pretty and would make a cool friend.  
Small note, i put my business card in their bowl once and actually won!  I got half off for the whole office, thanks ladybug ladies your the best.  

Once again Kevin, lets you know whats real, kind of like me

McDowell right accross from the Banner Hospital  right smack in the middle of the whole campus of medical buildings and offices.",4
"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.


It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.

When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.",1
"As a previous reviewer stated:  ""This restaurant is like no other"".  We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.  

First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.

Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry ""shooters"" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!

We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.  I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!",5
"Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice.",5
"The main reason to miss a star is that the one that we ordered (the mint-lamb) was a bit dry to my taste and no mint to taste at all. For desert we had the apple one and that was much better. I'd like to try a different one some other time and compare :).

Good environment, and for groups, friendly staff who would explain you what they are cooking!!",3
"You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!  

I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!

The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.

The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.

You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.",5
"Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing! 

We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. 

For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it. 
The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it. 

The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again.",5
"""You smell like smoke.""  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.

Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade ""adult"" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!

We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.

Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance.",4
"We came here on a Friday night. My husband ordered a dirty martini and it was so dirty, it came out looking like a glass of olive juice with some grenadine in it - it was actually red - WTH? It was the first time in his life he had sent something back. The waitress was cool about it though. She had to be, she has eyeballs too. We ordered the mozzarella and heirloom tomato appetizer. It was ok, nothing special. I have a pet peeve though - if you say heirloom, I expect heirloom and heirloom tomatoes, they were not. If they are not in season, that's fine, but tell people when they order. Then, we had the cannelloni special with sausage sauce. Again, nothing special. Here's the kicker - they charge for bread (not special bread, just plain ol' bread) and for parmesan cheese to put on top of your pasta!!! In fairness, they do give you one piece of bread with your pasta, but if you want any more, you are paying $3. Let's be serious - the name of the restaurant is Pasta Bar and you charge for grated cheese?? That's like going to a sushi restaurant and paying for soy sauce or a burger place and paying for ketchup. The cheese actually on the menu as a side. Are you kidding me? We're not talking special grated cheese. It looked like the stuff from a green shaker bottle. I wanted to add some salt to our appetizer, but there was none on the table. I didn't ask for any because I was afraid they'd charge for that too. I'm actually surprised they didn't have it on the menu as a side. We won't be going back.",2
"I give this place 3 stars because of how friendly the lady that worked there was and how amazing their prices were. It was pretty unorganized though and I am sure that it is due to people moving books to where they shouldn't be and there just being too many books to keep organized. It is not a bad book store at all, just be prepared to have to dig and dig for what you are looking for. Worth it though for the prices :)",3
Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.  The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that.  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.,5
"This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesome
and of the good ""Homemade"" quality. Known the family for almost 30 yrs now.",5
"Over Hyped ??... Yeah a little but its definitely worth checking out !
The pizzas are freshly baked and very minimalistic but extremely tasty ! I particularly loved the ROSA -  Red Onion, Rosemary, Pistachios sprinkled with just the right amount of Parmigiano Reggiano on a thin crisp crust ! 

The classy brick wall and the gorgeous brick oven give a rustic feel to the décor and you feel transported to another time.",4
"When I found out I was going to Scottsdale for a vacation, I signed up for Groupon and was excited to score a tequila tasting at Cien Agaves! Well, I didn't read the fine print and it was only for the last Thursday of every month.  Not a problem - the owner/manager was great when I told him I had kind of skimmed over the fine print, and he still honored the group on.  We had delicious tacos, yummy margaritas and left thinking how great people in AZ are :)",4
"Let's start with an SAT-type question:

Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.

a) Oakland A's
b) Rickey Henderson
c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium
d) Yankee Stadium

If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.

Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.

We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  

There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.

The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.

Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.

So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.",3
"This could possibly be 5 stars. Driving by you would never know this restaurant serves excellent Italian food. It is rather small and has a very different decor from other Scottsdale restaurants. I went on a Friday night and there were not many people there and I have walked by on other weekend nights and it was the same result. 

Regardless of that the food was outstanding. I ordered a special, lobster risotto and it was superb. There are many other things on the menu which I would like to try as well. It is rather expensive, but well worth it. The service was also very quick, and it should be when there are not many people dining.",4
"Just not a great Sushi Roku location.  The service was okay and the ambience was too - but the food wasn't fabulous and the sushi chef knew very little of the food he was serving.  When sitting at the sushi bar in a 'fine dining' japanese restaurant you kind of expect the chefs to be spot on and knowlegable about the food.  Not the case here.  If you want to spend this kind of money, go to Roka Akur - it's fantastic and worth every penny.",2
"Good buffet, albeit it's a tad on the more expensive side in my opinion.  We came here for dinner on a Sunday night for their ""Super Buffet"" which was $15.99 per person.

This buffet offers a large selection of food...hot entrees, made to order sushi, Mongolian BBQ, soup, fresh fruit and salad, and dessert.  I liked the fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, string beans, and this dish with tofu.  The egg drop soup was really good and the hot and sour soup was decent.  

For a Chinese buffet, they offered some quality desserts since some of their offerings probably came from Costco like the red velvet cake and cream puffs.  

Service was friendly and polite.  Our waitress did a great job with clearing our plates and offering to refill our hot tea.  (Hot tea was $1.60 per person, by the way.)

The restaurant is spacious and appeared to be well maintained.  Parking is easy since there's plenty of spaces in the lot out front.",4
"I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.

They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.

I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well. 

Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.

Chompies is the best!",5
"This is  the best Asian restaurant in town! Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week.
Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town!
 The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Tottie's!",5
"Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.",5
"After hitting up the bank to sign some paper work, I wanted to stop by the Biltmore for a quick lunch and had Paradise Bakery in mind.  As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  ""Cool!"" as I exclaimed to myself. 

It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!

After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.

Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.

Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!

The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.

The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.

Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.

I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.

I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.

I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review.",3
"Came in with high expectations.

Wonderful surroundings, I love the New York concept here. And the area attracts a higher quality of person, which appeals to me.

Place was packed on a Friday night of course , drinks were good, lots of attractive people, and a FABULOUS band playing.

However, the energy/vibe in the room didn't match the band's energy. There were many 40+ something men going after early to mid 20s girls/women. That resonated throughout the place. I actually walked around the entire venue to see if I ""felt"" differently, but nope it was all over. 

Not only that but people were indifferent about dancing in groups with strangers. I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or 4 and there was no welcoming. I was disappointed.

So we left after maybe 30-45 minutes, probably never to return, unless people start raving about the venue, which will mean either the people changed or new people have discovered it.",3
"I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...

I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...

I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!",5
"I have been here three times now.  Each time I brought a different guest. I have become a huge fan of their Green Chili Burger (I cant remember the correct name).  Sweet potato tater tots and the sweet potato french fries are great.  The chicken sandwiches rock, as well.  

I like the venue. And, I have always liked the service.  I keep coming back here because everyone has enjoyed it, found something on the menu they like, and I often crave that burger.  Give RnR a shot!!",4
"Some amazing friends of mine surprised me and set up a whole birthday dinner at Jug 'n Barrel! This was my first time here and was shocked at how cute the place was. Even in a strip mall it actually had a fireplace which gave it a very cozy feel. The wine list is great and not too intimidating. We had a great server who even put together a wine flight to match my sweet tooth. The only thing that knocks a star (More like 1.5 stars) off the rating is the completely average food. We had a group of about 12 and ordered several appetizers and all of us ordered entrees. I don't think any of us were blown away by our meals. 

Although I will not return for a meal, I would return for wine with friends.",4
"Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.",5
"Their food isn't bad, it's pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didn't care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, it's just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if that's your thing.",3
"Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.  My fav Barbecue chicken salad
no longer has a hint of the same taste. It should now be called flavor of tomato. 
 Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country. Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor. Im sure many people will love these new changes.  Yet, Im sad it's not the same. I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich! No joking!!!!!!!!!",1
"I am from NYC and have been in Phoenix for a few months! This Native NY'er is within walking distance from my hotel. I've been going their for about two months on Friday and Saturday nights for food, drinks and the karaoke. The food was OK, the drinks specials were good and the service was also good. The problem is that when a confrontation erupted at the bar the staff did not respond quilckly to notify the police. So, I ended up geting injured and when I asked them to call the police the did not, I had to. And after the episode they said they hoped It would not affect me not coming back again! Not even a comp or something! Just an I'm sorry what happened! I will not be returning at all. I looked over my nine charges on my statements and seen I had spent over $300 their. There loss!",2
"Tip:  If you know how to play poker...go sit at a poker table, and order the fried rice.  You get your meal for half price while playing poker.

The filet mignon fried rice(ask for it rare and it will come out medium) is excellent!",3
Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.,5
The best thing was the dessert. Shrimp was alright. Nothing to write home about. Wesabi chicken was lacking.,3
Love all their dishes!,5
"To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!  

Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.   

Other than that, what a great place to go!",5
"We went to Central Grille on Thanksgiving for their buffet.  Good food, excellent service and very nice ambiance.  We asked to sit outside and the weather was great for it.  Great place to sit back, relax and enjoy some food.  While I didn't drink they had a pretty good wine and beer list.  I will go back, enjoyed the experience.",4
"The boy and I finally check this place out last night. 
It was everything I imagined it to be. Great view from the semi-outdoors bar area, lots of beers on tap, and nice patio area. It was a Monday night so they weren't very busy, which was nice, I wasn't in the mood for a crowed. 

When checking out their menu online I saw they have my favorite beer on tap, SeaDog Wild Blueberry. It was delicious! Completely different on draft, but yummy all the same. They also had an Apple Cider on draft, my pick over a pear cider any day, that I could have in my Black Velvet (cider and Guinness). I was a happy camper. 

Only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked, but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers. 

The bartender was great, she let us try anything we wanted before committing to a full on pint. I tried to get the boy to be adventurous, but he stuck with the Stella, not bad at all, just a little boring. Oh well ;-)

I am looking forward to checking out Stand-Up Live soon as well, and the live bands they have at Copper Blue. I also hear they ahve a pretty awesome Ladies night on Thursdays, saweet! Menty menty more trips in my future, I can just see it. :-)",4
"True, you throw your peanut shells on the floor. And yes, my Asian family has gotten some curious looks when we've ventured here. 

ALL worth it. Great steaks, the sides that come with the meal are SMASHING, and the sweet bread rolls and cinnamon butter? Those are worth the trip alone, for reals. The portions are huge - and you know how sometimes food tastes worse when made in large quantities at restaurants? everything is still really good (I recommend the house salad and the chili). Did I mention that bread? We always ask for a basket refill and then take it home. haha.

My family's go-to restaurant for a good steak dinner. I could do without the hokey Western thing, though. Yeah, not much for theme dining.",4
"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.",4

"I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole (molay') dish (chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and you'll really like it... very authentic.

Chips are great, as is the salsa. You can tell its family owned... you can ask for Mexican cokes too I think. I've gone here twice and I'd go again whenever the stomach callers.

Sometimes they have a wandering mariachi guy. I always feel awkward when they come around because then you feel like you have to tip, but I think he sensed we were poor college students so he didn't come by.

I'm not sure what you ordered that you didn't like (to the first reviewer).",4
Food is consistently tasty and people are way cool. Take care of your bartenders!,4
"It was nice but not a great experience.  The music was very loud.    The waitress was very helpful and knew the menu and the wines and made some good recommendations (love the Newton Chard).  We split a salad and a pizza.  The watermelon salad was an incredible medley of complex flavors - the red chili giving the watermelon, avocado and goat cheese some kick to offset the sweetness.  Very interesting.  We got the funghi trifolati pizza and it was just ok.  After the first wonderful taste of mushrooms, it was all very bland with nothing to make it stand out.  I think next time I would try sitting on the patio as that looked very inviting and relaxing.",3
"I just started taking my car here a few months ago. Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and that's how they got my business.

I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I can't say for most mechanics.

The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.

Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs.",5
"Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.  

When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come.",5
"After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons. I checkeed thier priced on thier website, but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more, they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning, and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces. I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum. They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there. Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there. I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.",1
"Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect ""date night"" too.",5
"The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!",5
"Beyond the attractive decor and nice food-presentation, I wasn't all that impressed by True Food. Certainly the concept of healthy, sustainable, locally bought food is great (albeit in the form of an upscale-chain), but overall, True Food didn't live up to the hype.

On the positive side, the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty, and my Ginger Margarita was excellent. 

On the not-so-positive side, the raw ahi tuna app-special was just OK, and the tiny slivers of fish (maybe 8 total?) were more of a ""taste"" than a full appetizer. Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible. Added to the long wait (weekend dinner reservations are a must even though the restaurant is huge) and the pay-parking lot (if you stay more than two hours, which we did because of the long wait), we all came away mildly disappointed.

With many other excellent Phoenix-area restaurants to choose from, we'll head elsewhere next time.",3
"Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!  

Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.

When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  

There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.

There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.

Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!",5
"Ok, so this business is currently run from a mobile kitchen.  Now I do mean that it is a kitchen.  The crepes are made to order, the ingredients are absolutely fresh and delicious.  They are currently going to various farmers markets, Old Town Scottsdale and Awatuke,  and going to private parties when they are asked.  
So when you have the chance to find where they are and try them.  You won't be disappointed at all.  They are great.  
Also check then out on twitter.",4
"I've decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.  They still wont cook it less then well done which puts me off but at least it had flavor this time.

I still dont recommend this place when you can spend a bit more and get a real burger at FEZ, Zinburger or Delux.",3
"I feel sad to write this...but Vincent needs to improve things or his place will be only a past memory.  I'm ok with that based on the dinner I had there recently.
The restaurant was packed...but with people who had Groupons...I only wish I had because my dinner would not have been 177.00.  Too much for a weak and sad plate of out of date food.
We had the Foi Gras, small portion and so/so:(...Duck chimichangas they were decent. The wild boar was a tiny serving...we were fine with that because it was tough and difficult to chew.  It was accompanied with a hospital style vegetable medly of green beans with carrot shreds and minute white rice.  We also had trout..it was covered in a heavy white sauce (French) and had the same veg medly and white rice...seriously like the hospital food...or a big banquet service.  It was edible...but not great...We each had a glass of wine.  No dessert for us...it was hot in there and the arches and decor reminded me of a taco bell.  I wouldn't even go back if it was a free meal:(",2
"Went for the free ""Movies in the Park Free Family Movie Series"" last night and really enjoyed myself. The park has a giant inflatable movie screen where they show family movies every Friday night at 7 in the early spring months. 

Get there early to get a spot closer to the screen and bring a picnic blanket to relax on. It got a little chilly later in the evening, I would bring a blanket to snuggle under too.",4
Great flatbreads and atmosphere,4
"I like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone.

Unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret.

I would recommend to anyone in Arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about. I think everyone will be happy with it.",3
"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!",1
"I still really like the Studio Movie Grill, but sat in the ""General Admission"" seats last night for the first time, and found that they were not nearly as comfortable as the ""Reserved"" seats with their own little tables.  Unfortunately.

The GA seats are also quite tightly shoved together, so if it is a full house you are bumping up against your neighbor, and it is distracting.

Best bet:  Go to a un-crowded movie and sit in one of the reserved seats that is not pre-reserved (not pre-sold, and doesn't have the little ""reserved"" sign on it) to enjoy the reserved seats at the GA price.",4
I came to this location in Tempe after visiting the Picazzo's in Sedona.  I ordered the Puttanesca Pizza (no olives) with Garlic Butter Crust again because it really is THAT good!! I think the crust was even better this go 'round!  The Chocolate Chip Skillet with Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream is great and big enough to share!  We enjoyed sitting outside on the beautiful outdoor patio on such a beautiful day!,4
One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.,5
Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.,5
"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.

And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. 

Eggplant.

Ohhhhkay then. 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.

So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours. 

Just UGH in every way.",1
"This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.

The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again. 

Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out...",5
"3.5 stars. Needed a place to avoid the rain before going to see Tron with my mom at the movie theater next door. We didn't order food, just drinks. There's an OSF in Seattle, and having gone a couple times, while not super familiar with the menu, I know what they serve. Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts. Yeah... it's a chain. I know the food isn't the best and the service can be hit or miss. But the stars are all for our waitress, whose name I (of course) can't remember. I got the OSF version of a Jack and Coke, which had a cherry infused whiskey (it was dangerous, and at 7 dollars, doubly so), and my mom got a virgin Daquiri- our waitress put extra whip on it. A little touch, but one my mom really appreciated.",3
"I have been to this Mojo fro yo location several times now and really enjoy their yogurts! The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)",4
"Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious.",5
"best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood. 

i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.

the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.",5
"There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust. A good mechanic is high on that list. 

I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.

At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. 

Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. 

When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.

Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. 

The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!",5
"Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After 
Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. 
When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". 
And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. 
At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! 
So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!",5
"Being my first review, there is only one place I've always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlum's is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience.

Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners I've ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. They'll help you find anything you need.

Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joe's), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD you've been waiting to purchase. 

They also have a wide selection of used CD's and DVD's to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!",5
"Truly a neighborhood bar. Didn't know anyone here, and didn't leave without catching  everyone's name. Maybe not as wide of a beverage selection as the pizzeria-turned-bar in the same lot, but definitely lots more fun. Will return.",3
"One word: bleh. I know my Thai food and this place was about 1 star, an extra star for the nice service. I came here with my mom, uncle, and aunt and being my first time, I opted to order my usual pad see ew. We also ordered coconut fried shrimps, the mango papaya salad, tom yum soup, and fried rice. Honestly, the best thing about our order was the coconut fried shrimps. It came out hot a crispy and flavorful. Everything else needed help. 

The fried rice was too overwhelming, it tasted like too much fish sauce and was very salty. The Tom yum soup was a little bland and we had to add fish sauce to it, and the pad see ew was way too darn spicy for being a ""mild/medium"". It was full of this unpleasant pepper flavor that I definitely wasn't use to in my pad see ew as well. My aunt and uncle think that the place hired a new head chef or something, because since they're regulars, the food this time around was definitely not worth the bill. We ended up to-going 60% of the food untouched so that we can tweak it ourselves at home to our liking. 

All in all, there are other places around town with better food - 1 star. 1star for the friendly staff.",2
"Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again.",1
"Really like this place, wound up there one night by accident, as my friend  and I got disgusted with the lousy service at the ""other"" bar in the same shopping center as Tony's.
The place had a good vibe, jukebox playing, people shooting darts,  we felt totally comfortable, and found a table, to sit and catch up.
 Service was really good, The bartender, while waiting on another customer, made eye contact, to acknowledge me, and said she'd be right with me.  I like that in a place, ---nothing worse than standing at a bar waiting to order drinks and feeling invisiable.

My beer was good and cold,  my friend ordered a vodka and orange juice, and commented that it was a nice ""stiff drink"" -  

We both said we were glad we stumbled upon Tony's and will be back.",3
"Dr. Ford is great.  She came highly recommended and I can see why.  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.  Bring your animals here, they will be taken care of properly.",5
"My co-workers and I refer to this place as ""Pizza n' Ants"".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem. 



As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!",1
"I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good. Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.

Detail:

Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.

I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.

It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.

Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.

This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain.",5
"The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable!


Edamame was perfectly steamed

Sushi was tasty

Salmon Teriyaki was delicious

sake and kirin washed it all down

prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming.",4
I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if you're hungry stop in & get full!!,4
Have been to Pita Jungle twice before. Feel the wait staff do a good job. Always friendly and good service. Best hummus in town. For s dollar more get the bigger plate of hummus but ask for extra pitas (39 cents each) and some extra cucumbers and tomatoes (99 cents). Not a fancy place but certainly someplace you want to try out.,4
What a lame store.  The employees didn't say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.,2
"Amazing cheesesteak.

One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.

The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.

That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.

Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive.",5
"Two stars for bad service and, damn, I have to the tell the truth, a lousy appetizer.  Had the braised leeks to start, which appeared to have been made less of leeks and more of a white cheese that I can only assume had been allowed to congeal into a rubbery mat beneath a heat lamp.  It was literally impossible to cut into bite-sized pieces, and was tasteless besides.  

Then, after at least a half an hour wait, pasta with chanterelles.  The shrooms were great, and I have to say I enjoyed fennel for the first time in my life, but the pasta was enormous in size and there was an awful lot of it.

But one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes, which were wonderful, and another had the brussell sprouts, also wonderful, and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine.

They were very busy (our reserved table was 20 minutes late and the seats were still warm when we sat down), so I'm thinking they were just run off their feet.  I'd give them another chance.

Oh, and a delightful Arizona sauvignon blanc.  I'm told they serve only Arizona wines, which is kinda cool..",2
"So following the previously reviewed experience I received a phone call from the Dr. who was very intent on making the situation right. He did all the right things to make sure that we were certain that he appreciated our business and was very apologetic about the unacceptable wait the day before. This is precisely how any business should react to a bad customer experience. The subsequent visit to complete the wisdom teeth extraction consult was very expedient as was our visit on the day of the surgery. 

In short, the office resolved our very unsatisfactory experience in a very impressive manner.",3
"Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.

I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self.

We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.

I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare.",5
"Dave's has a good BBQ sauce and reminds me very much of KC style BBQ and side's.  I have eaten here a few times and found that the portion sizes are immense!  

Service has always been efficient and no reason to complain about anything.  I think this BBQ place would be the best option for a large group.

Is this the best BBQ in the world?  No, but I sure wouldn't turn it down!

Enjoy!",3
"R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful. 

We will be going back!",5
"Tilted Kilt is alright. I have been here a few times and what stands out in my mind is nice decor with many tvs, good beer selection, but crappy service and food. I am really big on service, coming from the industry for over 7 years, so when I get bad service, I get in a bad mood. The girls are pretty lucky they are hot because I don't think it would fly otherwise. The fish n chips I had were not good, obviously just poured from a bag, which is disappointing. I felt the server was really flaky and inattentive, she was sitting with a group of guys pretty much the whole time, while I was waiting for my napkins, then my malt vinegar, ugh. Then she came to tell us she was going on a smoke break and I don't think I saw her after that. All in all, I can appreciate a cute girl in sexy kilts (I was actually hired to work here when they first opened) and I love me some good beers and flat screens, but I will pass on the whole dining experience.",3
"What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!",1
"This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes...

Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book! 

This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too! =)",5
"I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)

The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  

We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.

We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.

We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.

Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  

I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:

1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  

2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.

Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!",5
"Okay.....so....I have this thing about going out in Scottsdale in the first place because I'm always like ""that one natural haired black girl"" in a sea of blonde, tan, slim chicas! But that's neither here nor there. 

The Lodge was OKAY in my opinion. For it to be in Scottsdale where everything is super expensive for no reason the drinks are pretty cheap. I had a couple of shots and a drink and spent under $20. The bartender was SUPER sweet and she knew my name by the time I came back for my 3rd drink. 

They have AH-MAZING food deals. Like, get a burger and a beer for $6. Of course it's not a top notch beer but.....who doesn't love burgers and beers??

There is music...coming from somewhere and it's always pretty legit, a good mix. 

There is like an intimate, cabin sort of corner with flickering romance lights when you first walk in if you want privacy but we usually go outside to the deck and people watch and/or play cornhole....Either way, I wouldn't say this is my favorite place ever...but I dont hate it either. 

Plus there is always a line of cabs outside waiting if you are too schwasted to get home :)!",3
"Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place.",1
"Lots of awesome packed in a cute little restaurant. Visited here on numerous occasions and never had to wait for a table. Service is excellent; friendly, and witty waitresses are a breath of fresh air. As is the patio, which is a perfect venue to enjoy a meal next to the fountains. The view of the gardens at lunch time is also a nice tidbit. 

Loved the chips too. Chimichanga is A-okay!",4
Our first visit. A bit quiet on a Monday night. Service was fast and friendly. Wife and I shared a hommus appetizer and Greek fries. We like our hommus with more zest i.e. garlic. Main courses were the gyro dinner and chicken souvlaki meal. Both were tasty with generous portions. We'll go back.,4
"I have never written a negative review but unfortunately I think this place needs to get it together. It is in a location that never seems to be successful. I drug my husband over excited to try it and hoping to see an improvement. No such luck. No vegetarian entree, not really kid friendsly, small portions, pricey. Not what we were looking for in an evening. Love to support new restaurants but wont be back. Hope they figure it out and make it work.",3
"i've been a mojo fan since... well, since mojo first became mojo. when yogurtology opened right up the street from my house, i arched a skeptical brow and decided to give the mojo-wannabe a try. 

*long sigh*

my newfound love of yogurtology has me feeling a little guilty, as if i've replaced an old love with a new one. such is life, i suppose.

the facts:

yogurtology has a wide range of excellent flavors of frozen yogurt that seem to rotate daily. i've seen chocolate mint, oreo, cupcake batter, red velvet, chocolate peanut butter, mango, blackberry, oatmeal cookie and vanilla bean, to name a few. each and every one delish. they also seem to always have at least one non-dairy option available...

the toppings are plentiful and varied. choose from fresh fruit, chopped candy bars, m&ms, nuts, baklava, brownies, truffles, cheesecake, sprinkles galore, ginormous marshmallows and gummy candy... i've never seen so many topping options in one place.

staff are very friendly and attentive. a little TOO attentive for my taste, but hey, i'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone unless i ask for help...overall, they rock!

loyalty punch-card? you betcha. so eat and eat and eat and score yourself some free yogurtology before starting the tasty process all over again.

lick a spoon and feed your grin.

"It's not that I don't like this place, it's just that it's very run of the mill. Bison Witches does the standard sports bar cum college drinking hole thing. That's all that can really be said about this place. You can't really hate this place for that because it is what it is. A milquetoast spot at its most average..",2
"I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. 

Getting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. 

Once I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. 

So far, so good.

But then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. 

Don't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. 

Having found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!

My first trip to the library was GREAT. 

Then the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some ""on hold"" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? 

This library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. 

I couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. 

So, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. 

So, let's recap:
*SLP has books!
*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)
*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. 
*You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.
*People working there are friendly.
*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. 
*It's not an easy place to browse.
*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.
*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.
*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. 
*There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! 
*You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. 
*It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.",3
"VOODOO Chicken was fantastic!  Most of the entree selections were available over rice or pasta.  They had many gluten free options and they use brown rice and brown pasta. I stumbled upon Jaspers Peak Bistro on accident and I am glad I did.  Cajun inspired food cooked well.  Very satisfying and delicious.

The server was a bit neglectful, but we were loving our food so much and the company of friends that we didn't mind so much.  The neglectful server did recommend the food we ordered and we were very happy with it.",4
Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.,5
"I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.

It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short.

Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.",5
This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day. I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.,5
I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!,5
"Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.

So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.  

The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.

Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.

Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.",5
"We went to downtown chandler to walk around and we took our dog Buddha with us since its a great outdoor area. Well we decided to grab lunch and saw that Santan Brewing had a great patio that was dog friendly! The server was very nice he even brought water for Buddha which we greatly appreciated. I ordered the Cochinita Pork Pibil served with rice and black beans, it was super tasty the pork was moist and tender and the rice and black beans had great flavor. John had the Fredo Shrimp N'awlins and wow it had such great flavor, it was a new orleans style pasta that had a cheese based sauce with a kick! The portions were very generous and we didn't have to wait long at all. Overall we will definitely be coming back!",4
"This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.  All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again.",5
"This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top.",5
"Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. I'll go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall.",4
"Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldn't get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have.",4
Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!,5
"Just have to rave about Becca and Todd's Zoo tour on a Segway. It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale.  I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks.  We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour.  It was fun, easy and worth every penny.",5
"We'd heard that this place was really tasty, but learned that the original location had shut down recently.  We found their second location and gave it a try.

It ended up being so good that we went twice in one week while visiting the area. We had a chicken quesadilla both times and on one trip added a large nachos with chicken.  Great flavor, good-sized portions, good value.

Would have been a 5-star rating had our server not forgotten our drinks and had the restaurant been cleaner during our first visit.  We were directed to sit anywhere we liked, but it took us a while to find a clean table even though there were only two other tables occupied.",4
"Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.  

Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.  

I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know, but I'm in love.",5
"I'm apparently not as big into Greek as some of the others have posted, but I can honestly say anyone who's given this place less than three stars probably just expected too much. I had the best Greek salad that I've ever had, and I will agree with one review that it was definitely too light on the feta. 

The service was great, food was excellent, and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side I felt as though it was a great value. Not one of the places I would take out-of-towners and rave about, but a great little spot to hit for lunch.",4
"This place is so cute.  To begin, it is trendy but comfortable.  The service is fantastic and the food is really good.  We were a party of six, and ordered a few appetizers (the deviled eggs were good) and for lunch, many of us did half flatbread/half salad..for a reasonable $10.  Mine was delicious.   I had a blueberry salad which was really tasty, and my margherita pizza was great.  The sun-dried tomatoes were perfect.  I will be back for sure when I'm up for drinks....a wee bit early for drinks today as we ate at 11:15.",4
"Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail.  There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasn't that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.  

I wasn't planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, it's not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually.

I can't wait to come back.",4
"This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.  

Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit 'slutty', but holy god.",5
"I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, they're on top. Good Starbucks.",4
This is a great dog park to have in the area.  It has a ton of room for the big dogs to run around and there are baggies and trash cans scattered all around it so you don't have to go far to pick up after your dog.  I also love that there are a couple water stations in case you don't bring your own water bowl.  The area for the small dogs looked to be a pretty decent size as well.  The only downside to this dog park is that the ground is pretty muddy so I'd recommend wearing shoes you don't care about and bringing extra towels to clean up your pup after they're done.,4
"As good as I always remember it to be.
Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)

Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.

I pass on the drink though, an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..

Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries
(in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)

I would eat here every day if I had the option.",5
"There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons. 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets) 
   I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.  
   Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.
    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show"".",5
Great great food.  Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale.,5
The felt that the food at Organ Stop was just So-So! Nothing special! The Music there is great! You defiantly go to Organ Stop for the Organ! Not the Pizza!,3
"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!  

I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)",5
"I am a hot dog lover. 

For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.",5
