The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.

Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.

While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best ""toast"" I've ever had.

You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history. 

The service is great, it appears to be family run. 

The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. 

I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift.

I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.


So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:

*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.

*Spicy Buffalo ""Wings"": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the ""wings"". This dish is a must try!!

*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.

*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!

Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.


Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving ""meat"" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  

Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.",review,YBVdmm5zlpLpi2_DiKsd2A,0,0,0,0

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP.

So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6"" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say ""it's organic, don't panic"".

My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them?

The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.

The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.

I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.

Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.

It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.

But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. 

It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. 

You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. 

This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway.

Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?).

After a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off). 

We asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.

Our waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. 

Looking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying ""I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!"" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water.

I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there. 

The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks.

Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.

What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.

The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.

In conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!",review,fpWiDfJVWqDNWbfft22anQ,4,4,2,0

The chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.

I tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalapeño and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. 

The dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone.

I am beginning to think my fellow Az peeps have no idea what good casual food is about. The service in AZ is terrible, all of customer service in businesses here is terrible, restaurants and retail.
watch out for the Valets, they drive customers cars too fast around the parking lot, here and Arcadia Tavern!


I am entitle to my opinion since I have worked my way through school as a waitress/bartender , valet service manager and service consultant.

YEQkTCmphjr6XKPh4m93AQ,2010-11-29,mSaa0X25WDBQYj5faxX1zw,4,"While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.

The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).

No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.

Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.

Will most definitely come back and hopefully take in some teppan next time :)",review,vLMwisRi7IWPooI9YZ1znA,0,1,0,0

I was really excited to score a seat at the sushi bar, eagerly hoping to chat it up w/ the sushi chefs. However, they seemed too flustered w/ all the orders that they made a minimal attempt to talk to me besides asking, ""is everything ok?"" And I think the Mexican sushi chef is new so the Japanese sushi chef had to instruct him on certain things a few times. 

I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi, per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef. While it tasted fresh, it was very blah to me... nothing special about it at all. 

A few minutes later, the waitress arrived to take my drink order. I decided to just stick w/ water and told her I was ready to order a few items off the paper menu. I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!

Anyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to ""cut"" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki. 

Since I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good.

The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.

I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.

They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.

The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).

Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.

I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway.

The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.

We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the ""Madonna Special"" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.

During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course. 

Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable. I hope we return someday!",review,r_5slEuf2V8ab3SZMHVfgA,4,5,0,0

Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon...

Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3"" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services.

I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok I'll cut this short.

This Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more ""quaint"" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance ""browsing""; this makes my girlfriend very angry.

I don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. 

One last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their ""surfboard"" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99.

Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.

I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.  

We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe.

  First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.

   That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.

   The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...

   Eat here. It's really that simple.

There were about 15 upstairs staring at us, about 5 at the bar, and 15 or so more servers just chillin around the restaurant.  Somehow, with all these people, they managed to completely ignore us for most of our meal.  Making a typical 45 minute to 1 hour dinner experience turn into a 2 hour ordeal.

The decor of this place is beautiful.  Cool, clean, and modern.  The music fluctuates from being too loud and inappropriate for the setting to being perfect with an eclectic but well blended mix. 

The pizza is decent, but very appetizer-ish.  It is cracker thin, which turns a lot of people off, but I actually like it.  The onion strings are to die for when they aren't completely grease laden.  That's an off and on thing, not really consistent.  I don't like their sandwiches.  They are unimaginative and bland.  There really isn't a lot to choose from on the menu.

Walking up to the rooms part from the outside/back is not very impressive, they kind of look kind of like converted apartments. But inside is contemporary looking, little older, but still nice. The landscaping is awesome. 
Beds are really comfy, the kind you sink into. Which is a huge plus for me, since i'm expecting and my stomach is pretty uncomfortable at the moment. 
No dated tube TV's, yay! We had an LG LCD, and the channel selection was decent, they were all in analog though.
I was worried about noise since this is right next to obnoxious Old Town, but it was really quiet. The only noise we had was a neighbor's dog deciding to bark at like midnight... (They are pet friendly and provide beds, bowls and walks for dogs)
All the rooms have patios so, if it's not bloody hot it's nice to sit outside in the morning, listen to the birds, and people watch. 

Our room came with a bucket'o'beer deal as well that we didn't use, esp since I can't drink. It was all crappy domestics of the bartender's choice.

They have beer-tasting on certain nights. I did not partake, but my Dad (who was visiting AZ) did. The food varies in quality (or perhaps just varies in quality of recipe?).

However, I highly recommend their grilled cheese sandwich on some sort of yummy bread (the lower end cheese sandwich ~ I have yet to try the fancy one).

After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we weren't disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste. 

Musketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po' Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal. 

and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.

Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their ""famous"" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back!

From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.
Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.
Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!
After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?
Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.
This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!",review,Lp_Ykqfbv5Q-oyGYlMGJRg,3,4,3,0

I recommend going during breakfast or lunch if your interested in their ""Specials of the Day"" that are on their hot plates. These items don't look too appetizing if you go by in the late afternoon or evening. 

They offer homemade soups and fresh cut salads loaded with just about anything you could imagine.  They have a small selection of homemade pasta salads as well.  

I had their pastrami on rye with their spicey, nazzle opening, and horse radishy dressing.  The pastrami was very good but had to be heated in a micro-wave. My sandwich was assembled very well so props to the girl behind the counter!  Their Italian pasta salad was excellent.

2.5 stars.

Didn't really care for the interior, and the tables outside weren't beckoning, either.  It was very antiseptic and cold indoors, with only the menu handwritten on the chalkboard, the plain-looking pastry display case (devoid of any ornamentation or even a sign of any effort in making everything inside presentable), and, what looked to me, an antique-looking espresso machine on the counter to lend decoration to the all-white interior.  It was also very noisy indoors, despite the fact that there were only a handful of people!  

Ordered the Mascarpone and fig jam on marble rye ($4) and the Lox w/ cream cheese and tomato ($8 or $9), as well as a latte, no sugar.  The coffee came in a paper cup... why?  Made me feel like she wanted me to leave.  Loved the mascarpone and fig!  (So much so, I soon acquired a jar of organic fig jam from Whole Foods, but I need to find good marble rye toast...)  The lox, however, was disappointing.  While I found the flavors palatable, I thought the lox strips were too thin (I had lox at True Foods Kitchen that were wild-caught and larger for only a couple of dollars more), and the cream cheese rectangles looked strange with its right angles (after seeing such a lovely presentation done w/ the Mascarpone and fig jam).  Made me wish I'd had two sets of the toast!

It was nice to see that they still roasted the coffee beans on-site.  I wish nothing but success to Toast, but I won't be going back-- at least not for a good long while...",review,0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ,3,7,1,0

Comparing the other culinary restaurants I've eaten at, I'd say this one serves OK food, but the others are better in preparation and taste.  I had the salmon and ravioli appetizer, which tasted OK, albeit too salty due to the salt crust on the salmon, and the ravioli innards leaked out of the pasta into the bowl it was served in, making it look less appetizing.  The entree itself was (poisson rouge) tasted good and was well prepared, but the dessert (black forest cake) mousse was too runny.

I should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco.

We chose this restaurant because it advertised gluten free pasta. Unfortunately, no one on staff seemed to know what ""gluten free"" meant. When we asked which sauces might be GF to go with the GF pasta, we were met with blank stares. It took several questions to determine that the marinara sauce ""might"" be GF -not very confidence inspiring. When we did get our meals, everything tasted fine, not fabulous, about on par with a Pei Wei type experience. I had a small side house salad, which was not on the menu, but was offered by the girl at the register.  The greens were nice, but not chilled, which was kind of yucky.  The balsamic vineagrette was not able to be GF certified, so I had it on the side.  It was just OK.  My GF pasta was cooked properly, and the portion was large but not too large.  I had the primavera with marinara sauce, and while the veggies seemed fresh, they were a tad overcooked.  My husband had a pizza, seemed to be pretty good.  My daughter had a kids meal of chicken tenders and fries--the tenders were a chicken breast cut into slices, which worked, and the fries were a tad bit reminiscent of Burger King's, with some parmesan thrown on top.  The kid's meal also came with mini donuts, which we had to ask for 3 times, but there were fresh out of the fryer and covered in cinammon sugar--yummy.  We ordered ice cream with a GF chocolate chip cookie--and what arrived was definitely not a ""cookie""--more like a gluey, gooey chocolate chip amoeba at the bottom of a dish with 2 scoops of ice cream on top.  Eh.

I tried to order an espresso machiato at the coffee bar in back of the restauant--the coffee girl didn't know the correct way to make the drink, so I opted for a soy cappucino--this was tasty and well done.

Some was pretty bad like the ceviche  and the desserts--OMG--how bad they are.  
My cheesecake was, obviously, a day or two old and had that refrigerator slightly hard crusting over it--plus, ever so slight smell from the fridge.
Not yummy.  The pies were alot of filling and few pieces of fruit.  Just cheap desserts, so stick with the meat and fish.

Finally I find one that lit up green so I knew the players card was working.

If this Casino thinks I would actually spend money to sit in their stinking cigarette smoke loaded casino, they have another think coming.  Hell no!
I also had a ticket to see their Showstoppers ""show"" which, if it sucked as much as their slots and crappy old desserts, I figured it wasn't worth it.

IT was just HORRIBLE experience! 

I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am. There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10. I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad. Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.

She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!! everything was done in 10 min! She didnt even the nails, didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file. Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :""Pretty? Yes?"" It was so far from looking pretty!

I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me

Her pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!! She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!! I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!  

The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger! OMG! I wanted to cry! It's the worse mani and pedi I've ever gotten in my entire life, and I do it every month!!

Went with a large group on a Saturday night prime dinner hour and it was a no hassle wait, perhaps due to the company, it was painless. The Four Peaks beer choices, games of skill and comfy waiting area eased it as well. Service was attentive as sometimes large parties are tough to handle, but I observed no glitch here. 

I do plan to return when excessive day drinking has not blurred my perspective, but I remember having some pretty solid food. I sampled the Fontina cheese appetizer, perhaps my expectations were askew but I was surprised to see cheese sticks. I suppose I envisioned a wedge of cheese, either way it tasted fine and the pair of dipping sauces were unique. Sharing the same dish a savory romesco balanced with a sweeter pear sauce, I enjoyed them both with the cheese. Skirt steak is spiced nicely with garlic, chile and cumin ,charred and sliced, smothered with tasty mushrooms comforted by a hearty scoop of Yukon mashers. Not my optimum presentation as I like to cut it myself. I think the beef, which tasted great, went beyond the medium rare request which seemed to just be ignored. Not enough resting time from grilling to cutting and plating I would guess, however the meat was still juicy .I also had the chance to sample the maple glazed pork with pear crisps. Yum. Well cooked ,juicy and chock full of smoky sweet goodness. The side of Gorgonzola grits was a bit loose, but the flavor was very nice. Portions were very generous.

* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.
* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!
* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.

That said:
* The green salsa was really good.
* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)
* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.

The soup was ok (bland, but ok), the sandwich was...well, kind of sad looking. A big dark green piece of wilted lettuce, barely any of the 'cranberry mayo' or whatever was supposed to be the mayo on there, the turkey and ham tasted great...there just wasn't very much of it, and they completely forgot my request for a side of mayo, mustard and a knife/fork on a triangle cut piece of wheat bread. I wasn't able to choose my chips, so ended up with some plain ones and my cookie was undercooked by about 10 minutes. The outer circle was baked, but the rest was cookie moosh. (Which is fine when you are in a cookie dough mood, but alas...I was not.) The lemonade was FANTASTIC though.

I ordered a ""Blushing Lady"" cocktail (gin, Citronage, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of sloe gin).  I'm pretty sure it was served in a dribble glass because I seemed to have difficulty actually consuming it.  But what I did have was perfect for me, and I would like another.

I also opted for the special that evening which was a tenderloin sandwich with poblano, swiss, watercress, and charred onion.  While the poblano and onion sold me on it, I didn't quite get the swiss and watercress.  It was good, but could have been better with another cheese IMHO.  Also tried the herbed fries (delicious) and the mac 'n cheese (not as delicious).  The mac 'n cheese was good, but lacked the gooey cheesiness I crave.  We finished with warm doughnuts and salted butterscotch.  Doughnuts were fantastic, and it's hard not to like the butterscotch, but the ""salted"" part was missing.  A touch more please.

Sure, you can theoretically pick up some new accents for your living room, a new pair of shoes, some books and the materials to make new candle rings in one go after which you involve yourself with movies and a beer, but you may give up in frustration before you ever find a place to park.

I dearly hope whoever laid this place out is no longer in charge of such projects.  There is no logic whatsoever to the layout.  Trying to drive between the lots can verge on nightmarish.  Needlessly huge islands in the parking lot put leaves in the way of ever finding what's across the way, so navigating the place on foot is often out of the question without even taking the Phoenix summer heat and wretched drivers into consideration.

Desert Ridge probably isn't going anywhere.  I've never been there that it wasn't busy.  It's almost impossible to avoid if you have any significant shopping to do.

The usual suburban chain stores can be found at this shopping center, ranging from Smith and Hawken, Banana Republic, Barnes & Noble and the like, though there are a select few independent retailers which make a trip to this center a little more interesting.  Parking can be difficult, however, there are lots that line the backside of the center as well as valet parking across from the center park.  People watching is quite entertaining, from the kiddies that frolick in the fountains, to Barbie's desert siblings.

The independent dining options are a little more interesting, such as The Green House and Zinc Bistro, though again, the usual unimaginative chains are represented here, including PF Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory.

Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!  

The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.  I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).  I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.  I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).

Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!!

Until recently, when I wanted to get some travel guides for an upcoming European vacation. Then I thought, hmm... maybe a library would be a good idea. So I visited the Mesa library on my lunch hour and I was amazed at all the great books they have there. Seriously, there were all these brand-new, just-released hardcovers just sitting on tables, waiting for me to pick them up.
I remember being a teenager and having to wait MONTHS to get new books. Now, apparently, because either a) no one reads or b) no one uses libraries or c) both, new books are readily available at the library. Well, good news for me.
I also think the Mesa library may be a great place to pick up decent books because most of the patrons seem to be really, really old or homeless and possibly illiterate. I'm not trying to be snarky, it's just something that's quite clear from the moment you walk in.
Overall, however, this is a very nice, well-stocked library. And you can even keep renewing your books on-line.

I did find it a little difficult to locate when I attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot. It was dark, late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location. The staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a Sunday night. For the staff and selection I give it a 3 star rating. It was good, but I didn't find it any different than the growing list of competition. 

I know this place is popular and self-serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now. The economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available. Customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish, which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices. 

All of that in mind, I don't like it (the industry). Too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next. For those new to the game, you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example, the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and I find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable. The other reason I do not like these places is that I do not like to pay for food that I then have to make and serve myself. I go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a) I don't like doing it and b) I am horrific at it. While frozen yogurt does not require much preparation, there is still some assembly required. If I am paying, I prefer to have it built for me. But I realize I am in the minority. As popular as these chains are becoming I wouldn't be surprised to see ""FroYo"" overtake ""unfriend"" as word of the year in 2010.",review,zCC6huLkNBEr3JUgQyxJbg,0,0,1,0

My friend and I ordered the egg rolls (sorry, I don't remember the Thai name), and they were okay. Two pieces, small (but the price was $2, so what did I expect?), and an average filling - something I would expect from frozen egg rolls.

We're both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu, but were slightly disappointed with the options. Three of the items included oyster sauce, and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or red/green curry vegetables. I ordered the green curry vegetables (medium hot), and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables (mild - and she stressed MILD). We waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didn't mind my dish - it was waaaaay spicier than medium, but I don't mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. My friend didn't like her dish at all, mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish. We spent $25 total, and I'm not sure it was worth it.

 But I do have to say that Abacus Inn does something nice that I don't see too often in other Chinese Restaurants. They give you hot tea and water and fresh fried noodles with sauces when you are seated. 

I had the Yui Shan Chicken, it was a fail because of the inedible Shiitake Mushroom stems in my dish.  Trying to eat the mushroom stem was like trying to chew a car tire but, I do have to admit the sauce was more developed than any sauced dishes I tried from the surrounding Chinese Restaurants including Bamboo Cafe, Ginger China Bistro, and Shangri La. I LIKED the use of cucumber in the dish was light and tasty and successful. Unfortunately the white meat chicken was dry. Maybe a THIRD STRING cook was on the day I was here and maybe this dish is normally prepared better?

The sautéed spicy beef was more successful. The beef was very well prepared and unlike the Yui Shan dish this Spicy Beef REALLY WAS VERY SPICY. I am used to a more developed and balanced Szechuan sauce so I wasn't a fan of this dish from here. But I do note this sauce was better than what you'd get from surrounding Chinese Restaurants.

The last time I was here I had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in a very hot oil and puff the rice.

The short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff, but it's basically just-ok carby kid food.

The long: On the south side of Thomas, just west of 44th St., turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic, but it's otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up, like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise, it doesn't stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period, and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick, though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush. 

I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome, even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon, the drink was so sweet, it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo, a slab of soft-in-the-inside, perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast, somewhat slightly crisp, thin crinkle cut fries, a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce), and, of course, four chicken strips. Unless you're me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two, but really, halfway through the meal, you're so carbed-out full that you don't miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken, and true to advertising, it was fresh. Sort of crispy, but not as crispy as I'd hoped, or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I can't even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally, every time I took a bite of that toast, I'd think, ""This is the most random slice of toast ever. What's it even doing here?"" 

So, it's fine if you're like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this, but personally, I won't be making a return visit.

The theater has a far less luxurious feel than the AMC Esplanade 14 or even iPic Theaters. Instead of comfy reclining seats, you're stuck sitting upright, and you won't get any blankets to keep you warm. The inside looks the most like a traditional theater that I've seen at a dine-in theater-and my companion mentioned the lobby reminded him of an airport, and the theater itself, a bowling alley.

Like the other two places, though, ordering food or drinks from your server is as easy as pushing the button at your seat. They'll come and grab your order (the menu is full of American food, similar to AMC Esplanade 14), and they'll deliver it to you throughout the movie.

Movie tickets are $9 Sunday-Thursday and $11 Friday's and Saturday's, which is way less expensive than iPic and around the same price at Esplanade. I heard people are arriving up to an hour early for weekend movies, so be warned.

We drank and ate during the movie. We got a pitcher of domestic beer for $15, which I thought was a good deal considering the two of us drank two beers each from it. For food, I ate a grilled cheese sandwich ($6.25), which came with French fries. I actually really liked this grilled cheese sandwich, since the bread was thick and there was lots of cheese, and the seasoned fries were thickly cut and tasted great. Some regular movie theater concession stand items at non-dine-in theaters are just as expensive, so I thought the food prices here were really reasonable.

Though the food and prices were satisfactory, based on the less comfortable atmosphere, I'd still pick AMC Esplanade 14 out of the now three dine-in theaters I've tried.",review,v2UqlUHA8d3lgTIby0CCFQ,1,3,0,0

I don't know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since I've had his food and was quite impressed. 

I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich. Such a cool atmosphere inside. It's like a trader joes/gift shop/paradise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel. You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.  

I couldn't believe the kalamata sandwich! If you go there and order anything else....you're wrong. Freshest ingregients I've ever tasted. I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden (which they do have there). 

Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there. Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well. Make for some unstoppable pancakes.

went to Lolo's for lunch on a Sunday- the place was nice and busy- waited maybe 3 minutes for a table.  Were seated but had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a high chair as the 2 they had onsite were being used.  Ordered the Te-Te's (2 chicken legs and 1 waffle) along with French Fries and Beans Over Rice.  Food came out with my entree about 4 minutes before my friend's did.  We were never brought out the fries or beans and rice- reason for it per the server- there was a big party (8ppl) slowing the kitchen up.

Food was good, not great, staff was very nice and hospitable. I will go back to give this place another shot- try something different on the menu as the waffles were super heavy and doughy.

While I half-enjoyed watching you spank the St. Louis Rams yesterday in the last game of the season, while scoring the most points in a Cardinals game since the 1970s, you still suffer from mediocrity.  Your win against the lowly Rams was hardly inspiring since that team completely sucks. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, can you please beat the piece-of-crap 49ers?!?!

You remind me of a nouveau riche socialite with no manners.  You have a beautiful expensive abode, but still seem like you're from the wrong side of the tracks.  Please tell your owners to stop being so cheap, beef up your roster, spend a little dough and take some risks and the ever-elusive glory years might be around the corner.

Last night, a jaded and cynical fan of yours told my friends (in Rams jerseys) in the parking lot, ""Thanks for sucking today.  WE usually suck and all, but your team was much worse.""

Fried Chicken and Fried Cod, they keep their fries clean and use a great breading recipe,  try it you'll be back for more.

The beef is ok, sometimes a little salty.  

mixers,
not the biggest fan but they hit the spot when you need to.  be creative and make your own mixer.  

Service,
well its ok, they do bring it to your table and when you do a drive thru don't expect this to be Wendy's, it will take some time depending on what you order.  Your given a number and a nice high school student will bring some food to you.
The service seems to be young here, they just like hiring someone looking for their 1st job or so.  No this does not create the best service but creates, our local future.  giving a younger kid a job is not easy to do and these kids will move onto another job and keep working this is good karma for Culver's Phoenix  and shows an investment in the town.

I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only ""try"" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is. 

Moving on, we somehow ""lucked out"" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale. 

The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose. 

The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up. 

The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable. 

The fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well I'm not really one to combine seafood and cheese, this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and I'd recommend it to a first timer, +1 if you request to add spinach. 

Finally moving on to the entrees, different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors, assortments and sizes. 

I myself ordered what I was told is sort of the house specialty ,call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal. While it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me, the flavor of the pork wasn't really there, at, all.

I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine. 

This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow.

Then there's a problem with the amt so she calls a manager, THEN she tells that mgr ""She's returning it because......"" as IF.

QkyN2vqQidQhotvOtPIrkw,2012-03-04,83cmKpSCdvkUepzdUIMORw,2,"We tried this out last night. We won't be back. 

There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. 

We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?

Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. 

Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.

I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. 

The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. 

I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. 

The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck.

We were the only people in there other than the dude who talked on his phone the ENTIRE time we were there.  He even managed to order and eat his entire lunch while yapping.  

I ordered fish tacos, as I had the last time we were there.  Something has changed.  A previous reviewer mentioned this, and he was on the money.  I received two constructed tacos . . .soft tortilla shells in the shaper with cabbage etc.  only no fish!  Two large-ish filets of fish were on the side!  It was really messy . . .I had to tear apart the filets with my fork, smash some fish into the full-of-cabbage tortillas, and complete my own taco :(  I gave up on the second one and ate the veggie taco and the fish separately.  I really didn't like the seasoning on the fish, either.  I thought it was too harsh and blackened.  Ultimately, the fish tacos were ""meh"" to say the most.  I will not order them again.  My bf ordered a sandwich and since he must follow a special diet, he cannot eat mayo.  He reads ingredients very closely and requests things he can't have be left off.  His sandwich came slathered in mayo, even though it wasn't mentioned on the menu as an ingredient.  When we looked around for our server, he was nowhere to be found.  So, while I munched on messy tacos, bf sat looking sad for the next 5-7 minutes until we finally saw the server and flagged him down.

""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).

Koreans (by ethnic group)  are by far the largest sushi bar operators in the USA and very successful at creating American pleasing establishments. The Cho clan left Northern California to come to the Valley for sun, golf and open sushi bars. They succeeded at all three. Loud House music, Sports Center on ESPN and lots of Shochu,  can accompany your fresh escolar sashimi and ASU roll. If your sushi'd out try the Nippon-Hawaiian fave, Chicken Katsu. A warm, ""Irasshaimase"" awaits all who enter this charming dollhouse sushi bar. 

By the way, I drank so much Shochu at Sushi Eye that I took a little nap on the gravel out in front of the establishment until Richard Cho came and rescued me from passing out in the gravel. A sushi chef and a finer wingman never existed in Chandler",review,mEMZxvHpemSxn1gl7Lj1Zw,0,1,0,0

Because of this, and because the best thing I've ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA. All day. Loads of it. Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it. I learned of the Tea District through somebody's ad and like them very much as well. But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix. And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers. And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees. It should be here any day, and I can't wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavana's Opus Rouge. I love red heavily tart, fruity teas. It doesn't matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it. In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit. I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong. I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want. With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart).
 
I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again. Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.

UYM3KZLe02XGmUx27AZl-Q,2009-07-12,iwMIeeKW0b94FQ0H02QCUw,5,"I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.

""Big deal,"" I thought. ""How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?""

Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.

A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.

My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.

When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.

After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.

The guy preparing food replied with a laugh.

""Is it good?"" I asked

Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, ""Yes it's good."" 

Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).

About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.

The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!

The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.

I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.

And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).

Additional Notes:

- Cash Only.

- Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).

- There never seems to be any ""Lumpia!"" :-/",review,E-Bd5r6Z3zMGA75_D4IRKw,4,4,4,0

I always ordered fried chicken (of course!) and the breast tends to be dry so I decided to do thigh and drumstick. Well, this last time  the dark meat was fried to a burn:(  And not only the skin but the meat too. I should have asked for two different pieces but I was starving, and my hunger won. A shame because I left without satisfying my craving for good fried chicken. The waffle was delicious as always and I ordered smothered potatoes which were very good. It seems with their mac & cheese  people either love it or don't. I'm on the 'don't' group. It tastes milky and not very cheesy to me. I may try it again, because I love mac & cheese and I have the hope that maybe it was just bad luck before?

I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever. He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.
  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.
   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.
  The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else.

Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.  Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.

Once the hayride was over, the ""tour"" was officially over.  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo. The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.  Yum...just kidding.

In addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.  This dog would make an incredible soccer player.  His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.

Turf = Coldplay.  Trying to give you what want and failing epically. All the things you are supposed to like - the things you like about similar bands/bars have all been included.  You liked it once, you'll like it again! Right?  

Much like Coldplay's pomp and circumstance that is ultimately soulless, Turf Accountant fails to be genuine on any level.  Its all carefully crafted to give you some blend of quasi-upscale, Irish, hipster cool, but it just fails to deliver. I knew it was time to go when I heard Chris Martin's voice.

-Elizabeth Rozin, Primal Cheeseburger

Who could argue with that statement? Checked out Delux Burger today; Delux is a burger joint that gets some serious buzz and numerous Best Burger awards from the local media. They are also a late night favorite since they serve food until 2 AM. This gives them street credit in my opinion.

The mystery dining companion, otherwise known as L. joined me for this burger excursion this evening; we arrived around 10:00 PM for a late supper. The seating is a bit cramped in the dining room and the patio. The Delux menu is very nicely limited, meeting my personal rule for just do what you do best. We both ordered the signature entree, the ""Delux Burger""($9.5), starring a half-pound of freshly ground Harris Ranch beef; supporting cast includes a toasted demi baguette topped with Maytag and Gruyère cheeses, sweet caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon and organic arugula. We also ordered the Combination Fries ""a la cart"" ($6) which came out before the Burgers. The fries were fantastic! They were served in a mini shopping cart (making them easy to share) and included french and sweet potato fries. Two sauces were also included with the fries, a standard ketchup and a house aioli which resembled a thousand island type sauce with some kick. 

The burgers came out shortly after the fries. They were impressive looking before we took the first bite - robust in size and the beef was perfectly cooked. Delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef; L. and I ordered our burgers medium and they were prepared perfectly. As we bit into these works of art, the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate. The beef truly is the star of this show, however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef. This burger really hit the spot.

I was able to command and conquer this burger, however L. was only able to master one half and took the other half home. Adam from Man Vs. Food would have been so disappointed with her. A few other good factors that Delux offers: Good service, fantastic beer selection, which are primarily microbrews from across the country, and reasonable prices. If Delux has a weakness, it's an atmosphere that's a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious, but the burgers are so good that it's overruled.

Overall, a fantastic experience... and another bite into burger history.",review,7tA04v45dzG8tADZGLrCzA,0,0,0,0

Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food. 

The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent ""Forget about it"". But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968. 

This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song ""Just a Friend"" back in 1990.  

The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like.

We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.",review,KcI2VGSvRhLAmw6vZrc8WQ,4,8,3,0

The service was mediocre at best, they seemed scattered and unfocused, took five minutes to get water.  I gave up on ordering anything else after that.

The food?  Bland hamburger, that was cooked perfectly in the center.  Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry.  Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters.  

Let's talk about this ""coal oven"".  While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven, you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant, they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e. pan fried!  The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger.

Overall, if I am going to spend $10 on a burger with no sides, it better be perfect, and this wasn't.  I would also hope $5 would get me more than two fritters.",review,weBPiwvT2a5t-2lRfZjr5w,0,2,0,0

It's not as hyped as Grayhawk, Troon, and some other courses but it's just as great of a layout, if not better than some of the more popular high-end courses in the valley (definitely better than the overrated Grayhawk). The course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time. You'll be toast if you don't hit it fairly straight on most holes, but you won't be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blind-shot-heavy courses (i.e. We-Ko-Pa) here in the valley. I've shot in the 70s one day and in the 90s the next out there.

Besides the superb and scenic layout, I also like the simplicity of the overall complex. It's not at a big resort, there aren't multiple courses, and there is no grand clubhouse (not that all those things are always bad). It's just the 18 holes, pro shop, and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food. The staff is friendly and helpful, too. It's like a neighborhood course albeit a high-end one. 

They have some great summer rates for locals this summer: Any day, any time for only $35. I recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts. I played yesterday and the course was in good shape tee-to-green, and outstanding shape on the greens. It's been awhile since I've seen greens roll this well on a $35 course here in town.

One last, but important, note: It gets WINDY out here. As in, it gets windy every day. The course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time. An early morning tee time is best since it gives you your best chance to take on the uphill back-nine without the wind gusting in your face.",review,XbzB2i2fjggHsPXtQcOJUA,0,2,0,0

I believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it.

Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!

Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.

My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.

I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.

I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!",review,1kED3-g-gqnc4JgHe89Xqw,13,16,15,0

-Sweet Potato Fries (sooo good--sprinkled with cinnamon by the way)
-Kisra and Hummus!
-The Black Bean Burger (the first time I ordered it, I asked the server: ""Now, is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good?""  She said, ""I totally know what you mean, no this one is good.""-and she was right!)
-Margarita Mondays (aka 2 for one Margaritas--check out the pomegranate one!!)
-The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm
-The friendly service
-The close proximity to light rail

Here's what we don't like as much:
-The slow service (sometimes it gets kind of bad, I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order, get more water/another drink, or get your check)

But yes, its very dimly lit.  I remarked that I thought Bonnie was right and they did run out of lightbulbs.... We were there fairly early in the night and it was very laid back.   (My husband was in shorts)  I didn't get a snobbish vibe.

The bartender was good, although I asked for a drink with Ketel One, Red Bull, champagne and grapefruit juice and he gave me one with Ketel One, champagne, Chambord and pineapple.  Close, I guess.  They have bag hooks under the bar which is something that I haven't seen much of here in Arizona and I was really happy about that.   (I hate having to sling my bag off the chair or lay it on the bar.) 

Oh,  it looked like they might have free wi fi because there was a dude in a chair with his mac laptop.

Update:

Ok, so I came home from Merc Bar one night ready to write an update to discover it was the ROTD!  Strange conicidence, eh?  

This time out we were there on a Saturday night which is a little more hopping than an early Friday evening.  Still casual though, people in jeans, sneakers, t-shirts.  (There were people who were more dressed up, but there was definitely those who weren't.) We were seated at a table this time which I would suggest since it gets full.  Even though it was a Saturday night I still didn't get a snobbish vibe, it was a laid back atmosphere.  Our waitress was a little slow, we had to flag her down every time we wanted something which was a little annoying and she didn't know what a Kir Royale was.

So let me break it down for you. We walked in to this cool little spot on the Sunday before Memorial Day and it was about half full. It looked like it was VERY groovy but I seriously had to use my phone to walk around because it was SO dark. We sat at the bar and not one of the bartenders addressed us for like 15 minutes. Maybe they couldn't see us? Anyhoo the wine list is interesting and I was having a hard time choosing something. The one bartender that finally waited on us had NO personality. I asked for a taste of a few things they had by the glass. They sounded very interesting but I had never heard of quite a few of them and I pride myself on knowing my wine. The first one I tried was a syrah blend that had something to do with chocolate and it was just that...too chocolatey. My friend ordered a glass of the Justin Cabernet which is always a safe bet. I then asked for the Tannat they had by the glass. It was awful. It taste like it had been opened for days. I told our personality challenged bartender and he went and tattled on us to maybe the manager? The manager then came over and was pleasant if a bit condescending at first. He said ""well have you ever had a Tannat? and I said ""actually, all the time, I know what they're about and that is no Tannat"" he then did agree with me and said ""just tell me what you're looking for"" I told him I wanted a Cabernet Franc or Grenache which they didn't have either by the glass. He ended up pouring me something that really was delicious. He definitely redeemed the evening because he was professional and helpful. We then ordered the flatbread with pesto and a few different cheeses and it was seriously one of the better flatbreads I've ever had. They had two guys playing live music and they were very good. So my break down is:
Atmosphere - 4
Attitude - 1 except for the knowledgeable bartender, he gets a 10
Flatbread - 10
QPR - 10...for those non-winey's this is quality price ratio",review,4QQ8qzf5TID7B_Enca7juA,0,0,0,0

I ordered the Chicken Romano (pan-seared with a blend of romano cheese & panko breadcrumbs, with lemon shallot butter, tomatoes, asparagus & yukon gold mashed potatoes). The chicken pan-seared with bread crumbs was great to eat, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.The asparagus...

My dad ordered the NY Strip, and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped. They checked up on us frequently.

In addition, the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar. The salad bar was great, but nothing like the choices offered at Souplantation. Also, because I ate the salad beforehand, I wasn't able to finish off the main entree I ordered.

The front desk team was incredibly helpful--much more so than you typically see at a chain hotel--and they gave us regular maps/handouts as well as printouts that were tailored individually for our needs.  Even more astounding, though, was the cleanliness of the room: the staff cleaned the room so well after our first night that when we returned on day two, it looked like we had just walked into the room for the first time.  (In my experience, most hotels do a better clean-up job in between guest stays rather than do a good job every single day, but these folks are the exception.)

Farm Sessions, where local chefs give cooking demos with produce from the market, is a great idea I'd like to see at my local farmers market. It did seem odd, though, that all the produce at the market was in one corner. It was the shadiest spot, so maybe that's why?

Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as ""worth it"" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly.
Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.
Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner.

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.

They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!"" 

Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  

The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.

Right off the bat, the area with the lockers (and really where you would get nakey!) is very public...that's the first area that everyone walks through.

The outside lounge area was also VERY tiny.  I went out there and walked right back in because it was full with little privacy.  By that I mean I walked out there and BAM!  A large naked woman scared me back inside.  Really?  G. D. people!  I'm trying to relax.  Naked out of shape people stress me out!  Just ONCE, I want to see a naked hot person walking around.  And if a woman goes nakey, do some basic maintenance first although that much hair does prevent seeing everything, so it may be a blessing...ugh, you know what?  Just stay clothed.  Please?

But my masseuse totally made up for that.  60 minutes of amazing...I forgot all about business and naked people who should be naked in private! 3 stars because Joelle worked magic! She was great and super friendly.  Even though the facilities weren't the best, I would consider returning for her massage.",review,dEqyN5C0z-9xnwnFw9J_OQ,0,1,1,0

I ate a piece of chicken, tasted like the grill.  I ate some rice, tasted like the **Burnt** grill. I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top.

The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  It's neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service.

I ordered the regular Al's beef with sweet peppers.  I usually don't order my sandwiches ""wet"" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.  The fries were thick but a little greasy for my taste.

fFlMAm0RBdfzrDfpicTPJg,2010-09-01,b8ZXt3WQpJrv4KfnzVOIFg,1,Have been in twice since my last review. Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere!! And sorry to say this is not in a good way. Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out. Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight! They were like natzi's with the seating you have to have 75% of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar. We should've just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers. Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers. At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted. I wasn't going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip. I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that. I'm going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time i've heard of this happening there. With that said.. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN!

I wished it was nice patio weather.  The place was very cozy and a little uncomfortable padded banko seating.  If the tables were only several inches higher, it would have been better!  

First off, we ordered Baked Brie and Raspberry  wrapped in puff pastry hors d'oeuvres with a side of grapes.  A couple of glasses of light and fruity red Portugal wines paired well. 

""Can I have some lemonade?"", nope, no lemonade.  ""How about Sprite?"", sorry, no Sprite.  So sad to see the look on cutie pie's face.  Even wine bars would have had something for him to drink.  ""Okay, water is fine.""  He gloomly said.  We promised him an Italian soda next door at Lola's.  He cheered up.

Killer pizzas, so I've heard.  We decided to order the Mozarella, basil (pesto instead), white truffle oil pizza.  The crust is amazingly toasty outside and soft and flaky inside.  Good 14"" inches for $12 pie!   We added Risotto with manchego cheese/chorizo.  It was very, very, very rich!  It was so rich, I wanted to reach for some bread to sop it up!

We were so full and carbo-ed up!  We didn't balance out our meals very well.   Good thing we took the lightrail downtown.  We needed to do a lot of walking after all that eating!

Kudos to the chef and the hostess/server, they were absolutely wonderful.

During my recent visit I went with the New Mexican Skillet, which consists of eggs, chorizo, avocadoes, cheese, and tomatoes served over nice crispy hash browns.  The chorizo was well-seasoned and not too greasy.  I appreciate that they have the options of egg whites or Egg Beaters, although I dislike the up-charge!  But you can't put a price on health (says the woman eating chorizo and hash browns).  The fresh-squeezed orange juice was delicious.

Portions are huge here.  Supposedly the skillets have two eggs, but I think I got more like 4, and the scramble at another table looked like it had about six.

Diane was our server tonight.  What a cutie!  More important is that the service was excellent!  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive ""Your more than welcome"", instead of the typical ""No Problem"" statement coming from young people.

I guess I never bought into the whole gourmet hot dog fad, and probably never will.  I've heard my coworkers talk about the dogs, and on more than one occasion seen astronomical lines at the counter, so I thought why not, it had to be good, right?

Talk about sticker shock, and only for a single dog?  Very overpriced indeed, on top of that, they managed to complicate a simple hot dog.  Various types of meats and topping options were a bit confusing, not because there were too many choices, but because non of them were really explained.  A little annoying for a first timer customer.  The dogs themselves are not bad, but I think you'd have to a complete idiot to mess up a hot dog.

We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni ""D"".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.
