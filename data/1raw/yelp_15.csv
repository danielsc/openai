Vb9FPCEL6Ly24PNxLBaAFw,2011-03-20,HvqmdqWcerVWO3Gs6zbrOw,2,"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying ""x large pizza and large salad only 23$"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. 

To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. 

And your salads are severely overpriced

Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.
If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",review,iwUN95LIaEr75TZE_JC6bg,0,4,3,15
FCcFT610nQBVcRdY-devQA,2012-01-14,6jRs2P6zTYMn36fVnCu1Zw,4,"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",review,40aklZ2SQPKnlTPZdvAqww,0,1,0,15

We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! 

I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!

The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too.

I used to love the refrigerator full of beers, the music, and the cool little home, not to mention the biggest thing, the promise of a full bar. Now, everytime I go there it's full of douchebags, they are out of the beer I want, and the music has somehow become sucky. Perhaps the biggest kicker... there is still no full bar! The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality. And I swear if I see one more dude with girls jeans trying to look cool with a bomber of the worst beer imaginable I'm gonna snap.

Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.

The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)

The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!""

On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.",review,mQba83gB018LlGt51r80ZQ,1,2,1,15
1621ir5mjVgbHwxCbMAEjg,2011-06-25,4TQTwp7lAca35ANmw2TD5g,3,"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!

I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.

The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",review,8qe2c5uRlAkvNFvDriBm1Q,0,2,0,15

From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.

Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!

One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!

I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.

We ordered everything off the happy hour menu, so I can't comment on the main menu, but the happy hour food was great!

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.

I went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.

Rentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.

Bring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)

And yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)

They require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.

It's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!

Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.

When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.

After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.

In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert.

Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.

The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars.

NleiJA9dpfKjhxe0cCD1MA,2008-04-17,7tg3X6RPdDYiyracX4YIuw,1,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:

The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.

We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.

20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.

It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...

By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home.

I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in...

Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). 

We went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). 

Lines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. 

We went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.",review,5fPTQulecWNd_j787MFEKA,0,0,0,15

I got the brisket platter for $9 (reg. $13) and it was plenty of food for a good price. The brisket was juicy while hot, although when it cools it gets drier. I should eat faster next time! The brisket also had a very dark pink smoke ring and good smoky flavor. the bbq sauces are good but nothing special. The platters come with 2 side dishes and I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies were not boiled to death. The carrot strips were just the right tenderness and sweet, and the broccoli was slightly crunchy. My other side dish was the sweet potato fries. They were good and went well with the BBQ sauce.

For the price, I'd definitely go back to try some of their other meats.

Each one that I tried was excellent.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious and each was very flavorful.  I don't remember exactly which ones I tried (I tried 4 of them), but each one was excellent.  They probably don't make a bad pasta dish.

In a fit of random adventurousness, I thought it would be fun to try a new kind of food for me.  I'm typically a weenie and afraid of anything ""weird"" so this is a big deal for me.  We drove out here on Friday night and at around 6 or so the restaurant was about half full.  We stood at the door for entirely too long while we waited to be seated.  When we were at our table, we waited entirely too long to get menus.  When we knew what we wanted, we waited entirely too long to place our order.  You get the idea.  Thankfully the food came out fairly quickly.  

I ordered the vegetarian plate that had collard greens, some kind of cabbage/carrot/potato thing, red lentils, and some bean/carrot/onion thing.  As with all dishes, it was served with the injera, a weird sourdough crepe thing.  I was a little weirded out that the bread thing was served cold, but I got used to it quickly enough.  Everything on my plate was yummy, but if I were to rank it, my favorite would be the lentils, followed by the collard greens, then the potato, then the carrot/bean thing.  

Eating here was a fun experience for sure, and not having any silverware definitely made for some creative feeding procedures.

""And you've never been to Chino?""

""Amazing.""

""Okay.""

Yet we never went.

On the drive home from the Children's Museum of Phoenix, I realized that I was hungry, on a budget, and Chino Bandido was not too far off of path.  I ran the plan by my father, checking to make sure that would be an appropriate Father's Day dinner.  I received a confused look and thumbs up.  He's not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences, but is generally a good sport.

If my friend and I had been on the ball, I could have been eating here for four years.  Granted, I rarely have business around 19th and Greenway, but I could have made Chino Bandido my business.

We both ate a perfectly reasonably sized and delicious dinner for less than $10.  Three cheers for Caribbean influenced burritos and homemade teriyaki sauce.

Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
The food was meh.
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.

One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.

We were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels.  When she was asked about the ""specials"", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?  Then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills, leaving the issue unaddressed.  PEOPLE!... if you have a crying baby, FOR THE LOVE... take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it.  We opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of non-stop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server.

She no sooner finished warming my coffee (I use this term loosely, as it was more like colored water) before I glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see.  This was the nightmare... I saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose.  Anyone who's ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the DRIPPING BLOOD!!  You would think a bloody nose would qualify one for a break until the bleeding subsided, wouldn't you??

We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with ""sliders"" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.

Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.

There were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.  All things considered, I don't think I'd head back here.  I can get a better steak at a Chili's-type place, and the atmosphere (comprised mainly of your younger Scottsdale-types) didn't really do all that much for me.

Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.

I also noticed they do catering.  I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ.

It was everything I imagined it to be. Great view from the semi-outdoors bar area, lots of beers on tap, and nice patio area. It was a Monday night so they weren't very busy, which was nice, I wasn't in the mood for a crowed. 

When checking out their menu online I saw they have my favorite beer on tap, SeaDog Wild Blueberry. It was delicious! Completely different on draft, but yummy all the same. They also had an Apple Cider on draft, my pick over a pear cider any day, that I could have in my Black Velvet (cider and Guinness). I was a happy camper. 

Only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked, but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers. 

The bartender was great, she let us try anything we wanted before committing to a full on pint. I tried to get the boy to be adventurous, but he stuck with the Stella, not bad at all, just a little boring. Oh well ;-)

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.",review,0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q,5,5,4,15

The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.

That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.

Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. 
Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!!

The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!

My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  

Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.",review,DPsmPEPp-TfNDaHiz7czSQ,4,15,6,15

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on...",review,5W6WBEosZH2-atKjYDTVFw,3,2,2,15

You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!
There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  
It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.
I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!

I did not expect ceviche in AZ to be so fresh and delicious! And not only that, but they also served it with proper cancha and Inca Kola is a beverage option (which of course I had to order). 
Unfortunately, I have to give my experience 4 stars instead of 5 because they were out of Aji de Gallina, which is what my brother had his heart set on for dinner that night.

I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many 5 star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return  especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.,review,QGHqcWMrAQg7d1rwY1Xyuw,0,1,0,15

When we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp.  Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.

The salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.

The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.  

Service was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.  One thing to note is that you cannot add tip to your receipt since you pay for your meal first, and then sit down, so cash will help for tipping your waiter!",review,uZbTb-u-GVjTa2gtQfry5g,2,3,2,15

This place has ""ok"" flavors. I had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. The toppings are ok. My friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didn't have to use her personal stash. 

Since it made her happy, I gave this place an extra star. I'm cool like that.

Hmm...let's see. They have a snow machine. Not really sure what this is for. It seems out of place. 

It's far from my house, and not really worth my drive. I guess if it was by my house, and I had no other options, I'd frequent this business.

The Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of ""sour"" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.

The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.

Anyway, the stay was a hodgepodge of experiences. 

Downsides: The room was nondescript on the whole, but the neck of the shower was pulled partly out of the wall and the shower curtain was partly torn and had red (?!?) mold on it. I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.

Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.5 blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant.

I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

The food is fresh.  While it's not amazing fish, there's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from.

The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down!
The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip.
The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.

Why they let me play, I'll never know:)

Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)

It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a ""Rodgering"":)

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)

Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)

When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)

After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:)

They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)

The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)

S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)

S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixin's""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(

They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.

I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":(

The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(

But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(

I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)

Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).

Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with ""it's just how we do things"" and ""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little"". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner ""really doesn't care"". Hubris is so unappetizing.

When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using.

I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.

Since I love pretzels, I was imagining all sorts of delights.  Hard pretzels in knots, twists, and rods covered with the finest chocolate.  Freshly baked soft pretzels salted, or rolled in cinnamon and sugar, or butter and garlic.  You name it.  They were going to sell it.

Well I was sorely disappointed.  Upon entering, I realized this is probably more of a mail order type business.  No soft pretzels, either.  They specialize in pretzels dipped in chocolate and topped with nuts, candy pieces, etc.  There were some boxes of pretzels already made up, and we purchased a few.  The honey wheat pretzel rods were actually pretty good, the small bite-sized pretzels were nothing special.  The chocolate was a nice quality, but not the best.  

Although they hand dip all the pretzels, they do not make the actual pretzels.  So if you're on a local foods kick, which I'm not, this isn't the place for you.  Not bad to have around the house and for gifts to pretzel lovers or corporate gifts as they are better than the products you would find in most grocery stores.

Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket.

The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years we've been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever!
The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said ""Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles"".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!  
Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.

Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.

Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!

I would have liked them to be a bit bigger, but I was the only one that felt this way, maybe I eat too much?? I had the bone in porterhouse steak and it was pretty darn tasty. They serve the steaks with a variety of sauces to dip into, some of them were amazing, others were not. I would for sure recommend this place to someone looking for a 5 star dining experience. Make sure you bring your wallet cause this place is not cheap! Our meal was about $450 out the door for a table of 4. We ordered 3 apps, and 3 sides also and a bottle of wine. This restaurant is operated by Chef Jean George, I have no idea who he is, but the waiter and hostess both swear that he is someone to know. Judging by his cooking, I think I would get along just fine with him.  J&G is inside the Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, I was staying there so I figured I could add this place to my list of great American Steakhouses. My final opinion of this place, it is exactly what it says it is. They meet the B-Stew standard for a fine dining steakhouse. Also, there are great views of Camelback mountain. One last thing, the hostess at this place sold me on coming when I called for information. Very well trained and passionate about her job",review,hgRNpDq9_l_g36i46017fw,0,1,1,15

 I recently moved over to the N. Phoenix area, and while craving some Vietnamese food a few months back, I decided to  browse ""Yelp"" to find it. I came across these reviews, and decided to check it out regardless of the poor comments of this establishment. I phoned in my order without looking at a menu,  ( Chicken Pho, Egg Rolls,& Spring Rolls) nor  knowing where they were even located, I eventually found it in the little nook of the Fry's shopping center. I walked in to a very tiny little restaurant  with a cute little man standing at the cash register holding my wonderfully smelling  food in hand.

 When I got home, I realized that he had forgotten to add the Noodles (which obviously is the  biggest part of this dish) I was a little miffed but eventually got over it, once I tried the appetizers we ordered,and the wonderful flavor of our pho. I knew it was such a harmless mistake so I didn't hold it against them. After consuming our wonderful and inexpensive meal I came to the realization that THIS is my new Fav Vietnamese spot in the N Phoenix area.. I've eaten their at least 5 times since I found this place in Jan. That says something in my mind!! 

In my opinion they  beat Pho Bang, and Avina HANDS DOWN!!  It's clean, inexpensive, flavorful, and definitely NOT tasteless.. A definite treat if you ask me. Speaking of which I think I'll order some now :o)",review,mQekDIvOCHR8bPLH7Rpbpg,2,3,1,15

Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood. We were on the horns of a dilemma : ? Would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet? Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south - north Scottsdale....??

We opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club.

** A) never drink and drive in Scottsdale ( or anywhere else for that matter)

**B) if you're a foreigner - never- ever drink and drive in Scottsdale

**C) A + B refer to you Nikolai Khabibulin

( I would go as high as a correlation of 0.95 if high and low marks were thrown out ( similar to olympic skating or gymnastics)))


We arrived at the club---- a good bar crowd ( not quite as Mountain lioness(y) as i had expected (? hoped?) -- ? mid week perhaps...?,
a good blend of hipsters , hobos and Mrs Lovey Howell III's

Now - I don't like Sake ( see note above) - but on occasion - I like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like Sake- hence , I order a Grey Goose Sake Martini -

"" I have no Sake"" the waiter announces sadly.
Now - this is tricky - can I in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that I really don't like or want in the first place?

Too bad for you Ocean Club 'cause yes I can.

I am captivated ....( or is it the Grey Goose)

?? does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont...??

I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and ""Small Business Saturday"" I thought ""why not give them another try"", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said ""Oh, I have another one in the box"" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said ""NOT cool at all"" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.  

I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.  

I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores.",review,5Td84D4oDkkgxsMeqcrTRw,0,2,0,15

Unfortunately for those of us that like good food AND good service the food is crave worthy- better than any breakfast I have ever had, so simple and so, so, yummy. That being said, I have never been to a restaurant that ran out of cream for coffee. Not only that but they made it seem like no big deal, no apologies. I had one too many bad experiences and have not been back since. I have been tempted many a time to go back and see if they have changed their evil ways, but I just can't bring myself to do it. We'll see- life is too short to hold grudges, especially when good food is involved, right?

Came here for dinner yesterday night with my bf and his apartment-mate...we got a table right away but even for a weekday they were still half a full house. The first thing I saw on their menu was the Crispy Alligator appetizer. ALLIGATOR! ooooh but then I wanted to try their oyster appetizers cause they sound good too....ahhhhhh their menu is full of yummy choices! It was difficult deciding what I wanted to get...but after much debate....my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu. 

So the Oysters Duo -- comes with 3 oysters on half shell baked with a parmesan romano cheese sauce and 3 oysters on half shell topped with crabmeat, spinach and drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. -- oooh they were both delicious however I recommend the later one more just cause it's very unique to this restaurant. I got to also try a few pieces of the Crispy Fried Alligator from our friend's Appetizer Trio Platter - It was pretty good actually tastes like chicken...but surprisingly more tender - I was thinking alligator meat would be tough and rough but not at all....I wouldn't have known it's alligator meat if you didn't tell me. But now I can say I have had alligator meat!

The Pappadeaux Platter was pretty good - everything is well  -- fried! However I like the blue crab cake the most, the mini fried crawfish (kind of like popcorn shrimp) is second best however I have to say that the fried Tilapia was a disappointment because it was sadly bland and really dry...it was the only thing I didn't like on the platter. but everything else was good. - - I even tried their watermelon lemonade and it was super refreshing!

I was really excited for dessert cause I saw them carrying around a platter of sample of the desserts that they have...so when we were ready for dessert I was excited to see the dessert platter - unfortunately there was nothing on the dessert platter I wanted because they all looked really rich and sweet....such as their sweet potato pecan pie, key lime pie, praline cheesecake, praline bread pudding souffle or turtle fudge brownie was just too much even for the eyes..lol They were also massive in portions so I decided not to have any.

Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy.

They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh.

Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 15 minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for ""fast food"", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of ""fast casual"".

Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. 

The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.

Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.

Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.

Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!

Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.

The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. 

One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.

Overall two thumbs down.  Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley.",review,JnRT9i2d71pY8D8ngzCz9Q,0,1,0,15

I went because I wanted to feel stronger, especially in my core.  I run and am a generally active dude, but wanted something more out of my physical body.

I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat - she is a great teacher, which if personal training is anything it is a psychologist/mentor/butt kicker/saint...so in my book that is a great teacher!!  

Case in point:
A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving - mostly just my own mind being negative.  So Heat said, ""Next time we will try the very first workout we did.  Cool?""  I was game.  Dude!  I blew through that sucker - to the point were I was like ""this is cake""...of course on the second and third time through the sets  (and I think fourth on this day...) it got harder and harder...and I totally kept up.  It was awesome.  I loved it.

The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions:
- Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both?
- Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.)
- Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted.
- Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available.

The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple.",review,g0QWJpYSfWKxQiel7gbFuw,3,4,4,15

We sat indoors both times.  When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is popular, but I prefer indoor seating.  It feels comfortable sitting inside.  The way the tables and booths are set up it feels comfortable, and not crowded.  The spacing is just right.  During peak times, there is a full bar inside to relax while you wait for a table.

We started with tuna tartare, guacamole and chips.  It was a good choice.  We also ordered some beer.  The beer choices were limited.  The table next to us had a pitcher of sangria ... that looked like the better choice.

For dinner we had the short rib tacos and the ahi tuna.  My son had the kids meal mac and cheese.  I've had the short rib tacos both times I've been here, and it's outstanding.  The braised meat is tender, and served with corn tortillas, beans, guac, tomatoes, etc.  All of our meals were good, but the short rib tacos were the best.

NH67MdKaFGNcP-dlu56pyw,2008-11-16,_sBjoWMQk-XavBoj6mSJlA,1,"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.

On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.

Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).

Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.

I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.",review,Y2-KtEL3k8Ai5gLzeIRX9w,5,4,4,15

With all the hype that this chain has garnered, I found that little of it held up.  As soon as I walked in the door I was overwhelmed by the smell of smoke that the griddle was wafting through the restaurant.  There were plenty of people cooking and preparing the food, yet it all looked chaotic and unorganized.

Just as other people have mentioned, you can choose a whole array of toppings to customize your burger.  That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly (which mine was not).  Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.  Along with my burger, I also ordered the regular-sized Cajun fries.  These were definitely fully-seasoned, so if you are averse to spice don't order them.  The regular order of fries turned out to be a modest cup of fries stuffed in a brown bag full of more fries.  It is almost as if Five Guys' strategy is to overwhelm you by their generosity with their fries, so that you forget that their burger is mediocre and their fries are sopping wet with grease.

Normally, we don't ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so that's what we asked for this time during audition.
And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad.
Why you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment.
He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak!
With each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.  
It will be an amazing experience!!
Really, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  It's all fabulous.
If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!",review,ru8p3RTlk8f9LB_3zLXURQ,1,0,0,15

It's a cool little spot around 12th st and Oak, in the middle of a neighborhood. The decor is very modern, but warm and inviting. We opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had. They had a balanced but approachable wine list, I had an awesome Tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass!  We opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer, which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce.  I really really liked this dish, the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked. Not sure about the banana sauce, but overall a great dish. We then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy Schreiner's Chorizo and Manchego. It came with dressed spinach, prob one of my fave dishes in Phoenix right now!  We also ordered the macaroni and cheese and I forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered. The bread and garlic was just okay, nothing special.  I, surprisingly, was not a fan of the mac and cheese either, it seemed very grainy (I know it was chock full of parmesan so that's probably what it was, but it was just unappealing to me).

Anyways I am a vegan so asked about their vegan options. They said that pretty much everything was made with lard (I didnt know that people really still used that) but they said that they had a vegan burrito. I was assured that there wasnt any kind of un-vegan ingredients (such as cheese) in it. I ordered the vegan burrito with much skepticism. Once I got home and got about half way through the burrito I got a big mouth full of CHEESE!! 

I was so upset because I was assured that it was vegan and did not come with cheese. But even worse,  I think that they started putting cheese on the burrito and then realized that it was supposed to be the vegan burrito with no cheese and they just kind of picked what cheese they could off and left the cheese that they couldnt easily pick off on there. I am not positive thats what happened but im pretty sure.

Anyways aside from the fact that they REALLY messed up my order, the burrito was just okay. It was really pretty greasy. My fiance on the other hand seems to enjoy this place, he gave it 4 stars. He said that it is a good place for greasy mexican, and on Wednesdays you can get a huge burrito for only 5 dollars.",review,O-zVhDi_TeMs6R2Rz31g4Q,0,2,0,15

At Sonora Mesquite Grill, I have found such a place that makes food on the spot, using only fresh ingredients, and genuine care for your experience. You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster, maybe have a plasma TV in your face, but I'm willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave. 

Celina, the kind and welcoming owner, wants people to receive the absolute best food possible. This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire. No, there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners. Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat. Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone? Perhaps not, but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic, modest, great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora. 

If going for the first time, make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas. Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill. Simple and great flavors at their very best.",review,uylA7dxa7t6wUWN6FlOMcQ,1,1,1,15

Service: 5 Stars - very nice staff, and the food was delivered to our table pretty quick and everything was correct.
Food: 3 Stars - the Kids Cheeseburger got rave reviews, my daughter said it was better than mcnuggets, and better than The Original Hamburger Works (down in Phoenix, next to Encanto Park) so I give hers a ""5-stars"" score.   I ordered the Arizona Smashburger (1/2 lb) and was generally satisfied (4-stars).  This was my first time there, so I was not familiar with all the hub-bub of the ""Smash"" - but the 1/2lb burger was a good 1/2"" wider than the bun itself.  Not a pretty site.  The Guac was so-so, chunky but lacked a savoryness.  The Habanero Cheese, Chiptole Mayo and fresh (not pickled) jalapenos were all very nice.  I would have preferred a thicker hunk of beef, and the same fixings.  The red onion was pithy and only one thin slice, while they did give me two thin slices of tomato where were enough to give about 50% coverage of the ""smashed-out"" beef patty.  The pepper bun was nice, I'd like to get them for my regular grilled burgers actually.  Good bread, held up very good with the rest of the burger.  The Kids Fries - eh...  thin and I didn't take a bite but for the record they looked to have the same dimensions as the Fast-food golden arches fries.  The Onion Rings (ahem... Haystack) were a HUGE disappointment.  I like a thick cut onion, nicely battered and fried.  These were pithy thin, tiny slivers of onions dripping with batter and goo... not what I would recommend anytime. (Burger, 4-stars, Onion Haystack 1 Star, net it out, 3 Stars for my meal.)  I guess I don't get the whole ""Smash"" thing.  Call me a noob, but don't call me to go back there again.

If you are a picky burger guy like me...  and like to ""dress your burger"" all fancy, or if you are a picky minimalist... I have to recommend Fudds or The Original Hamburger Works.

To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! 

Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.

This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's.

sbD4f8aOsXZ6PJYh1kN4Ag,2008-06-03,ydSFkQQw5UiK2n2JRVtuxA,2,"No offense to locals, because Glendale ""Glitters"" with ""Chocolate"" downtown, but this mall hastily developed around the silver Jiffy Popcorn pan  that is University of Phoenix Stadium (misnomer, it is for the professional football team, the Arizona Cardinals, named after the omnipresent UofP distance learning and professional college, ala National University) and the Jobing.com (local based employment dot com) Arena (home to the NHL Coyotes) is really just a North Snobsdale (aka Scottsdale, Snotsdale, She'sGotTail) Kierland Commons Wannabee Mall!

It is 4 stories high, shaped like a football and stadium, with huge billboards facing into the 2 water fountains, its only redeeming value.

It is populated with typical Scottsdale type restaurants....Big on decor, small on taste, with chain restaurants peddling Chef/Designer highly stacked fusion flavors masking average casual food for a larger tab per serving. 

Even the hords of young, large bossomed hostesses, bartenders and waitresses in black t-shirts are the attractions that were first ubiquitous in Scottsdale, then downtown Phoenix around the Diamondback Stadium, has now moved to the west side of the Valley! Margarittaville, Johnny Rockets, Fox Sports Grill, Kabuki Japanese...all formula chains for the average masses who think they are getting something special, but aren't. 

Meanwhile, the Superbowl early this year, the reason why this complex was completed (and for the new football Stadium) has come and gone, the housing boom has collapsed, and the westside house prices have dropped 30 - 40%. Consequently, within a couple of blocks, the luxury condos are being auctioned off, the Westgate Offices atop the stores are empty, and so are the new office buildings. 
The anchor Hotel the Renassaince, also a Westin of Kierland  poser, is nicely lit but largely empty. There is a conference center attached, so it might get some occupancy other than Football season weekends, but the Homewood Suites nearby has got to be a summer bargain hotel.

This is classic Valley gaudiness at its worst. And it is set conveniently off the Loop 101 at Glendale Road near the Agua Fria riverbed, but otherwise it is a vast open field of former farm land. Still, it is the only decent mall within miles, so it is a beacon for the young and bored westsiders looking for something besides their quiet bedroom communities of strip malls and convenience stores.",review,2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w,6,7,4,15

Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.  Nice all around.

Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.  I did not check by the glass.  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected.

Husband had:

Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious.

Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly.

Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.  Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato).

I had:

Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You can't imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.  You might as well as shaved gold on the side.

Sliced filet - I'm not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES! (Is it fantastic? Is it cooked to perfection? Is the flavor wonderful? Is it a great cut?)

Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.

It also is so understaffed it's impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And that's not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain it's a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.  

I wouldn't shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellip's it's a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   It's well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.

7UZQ6qGX8lP7a3jokfYVjQ,2011-03-28,ysXcFqnWNQ33d_Qh0-cClw,1,"Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. 

Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. 

As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... 

So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. 

By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. 

In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid.

""Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'""... only if I said that to her face...

Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.

Visited with the bestie a nice quiet weeknight to enjoy some girl time.  You can get a 3 course meal for $35 and pick from salads, meats or what I would call side dishes.  It's a bit pricey for what you get portion-wise, unless you decide to order 3 meats..but who does that?  The wine is very reasonably priced.  The food is amazing!  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and presented to be delicious.  The decor is very simple, feels like you are in a big open warehouse.  It'd be a great place to have a group dinner for 6-10 as they have these rooms that are a bit more secluded they could put you in.  The service was a bit too good, to the point where we almost felt like she was rushing us even though there was nobody else in the restaurant.  

I'd visit again, but this is definitely a place to take another food loving girl friend- the boyfriend would be hungry and feel ripped off, it's just not his style...",review,CJOjw2P9zkPxOnnmrY6KjA,0,0,1,15

So, walk in and would agree that the ambiance was less than. Dinner tables were cheap and the table cloth was tacky. Oh almost forgot why is there a large mirror on the wall? Were given dinner menus by a impolite waitress who I suspected was surely going to be the owner. The first thing that hit was the prices! $$$ I kindly asked the waitress if I could just have a Gyro sandwich. The answer was NO! (rudely). Those are only available during lunch time! Ok, so next option was to gamble on a gyro plate priced at $14.95. We placed our order and waited. The food arrived on a timely manner. The food was hot and looked good. The tzatziki-sauce was a 10! Although the gyro meat was not to my tasting, it was ok for being real hungry. Eventually the waitress started warming up to us! :) 

PROBABLY WONT RETURN AGAIN.

Pros- Fresh food, Location

Cons-Couldn't get what I really wanted.(A gyro sandwich)

We started with a plate of three delicious cheeses.  They have a huge selection of cheeses, probably about 20, and we chose a goat, a smoked gouda and a jack.  All delicious and served with crostini, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth bartlett pears, pecans, honey and quince paste.  Great start.

Our next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad.  Both good.

My main course was AMAZING.  It was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots.  I ate every bite.  SO flavorful.  My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes.  My mom got swordfish.  It was not cooked properly when it first came out, but they promptly corrected the problem, so i can't fault them for that.

The ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace.  In addition, I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served.  She knew where the fish was caught, how the beef was raised, what certifications the turkey farm had achieved.  It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question.

My only reservations would be 1) definitely is ""slow"" food, maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2) i'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable.  They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish.  My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted.  I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.

Take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.  

A few of my favorites
1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection!
2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going?
3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad
4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if you're into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four.
there are more, but I promised to keep it short.

Back to the line. As you're making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number.

Just a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if you're planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as you'll let them.

And now you know what to expect.  If you don't like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Let's just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . I'm out!  Enjoy!",review,AirVzN1BVQBmq5zY0YMNYQ,2,4,1,15

Their food and drink specials are a great way to wrap up the week on a Friday night. I like their chicken strips and the cheese curds are great. The pretzels are also delicious. Service is typically pretty good, you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly. There's a lot of entertainment there, with corn hole and giant jenga outside, and some video games and a pool table inside. 

I don't love the Lodge as much for a prime time or late night spot...It gets a lot more expensive and a lot more crowded. Go for happy hour, order some cheese curds and a $3 Miller Lite and you're bound to have a good time. The decor is kinda fun, there are random acts of taxidermy inside and it's very, uh...Log cabin like.

Monday night: not busy a couple people eating out on the patio, and a large Indian family eating there, seems like they were talking about the recent demise of Bin Laden and they had their children there eating and studying, so I imagine it was all owners family.  But they weren't annoying and well behaved.  

Greeted immediately, felt welcomed and liked the look of the decor with a kind of strange old time piano music in the background, they served us some crispy, spicy rice (?) cracker with two sauces.  I really liked the taste of those.

Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium heat) and we also ordered, oh what is it called, chicken something with spinach, and garlic Nan bread.

Chicken tikka masala was very nice, it came in a kind of pot that was still bubbling.  I like that, the only thing was I would have preferred more spice, so next time will go with hot and not medium.  The other dish was decent but could have used a bit more kick, but that was ordered mild so that was our error.

Great iced tea, very refreshing and they kept it filled without asking.
I wish I lived in this area, all the cool restaurants are in SCOTTSDALE!! Son of a mother, why is that the way it is?  Not fair.

-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ,2012-08-13,dfbCyy0y_jzeWotFcEuEuw,5,"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.

Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.

Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.",review,5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA,3,6,2,15

Decided to go fairly late Saturday before they closed and at about 2pm the place was pretty packed. Was given a choice to sit at the bar which wasn't a problem. Impressed by the transformation as this location used to have a Tokyo Express which I would go to at least once a week. I was joined at the bar by 3 other people and given menus. Only issues I have with my whole meal is that they should have decided the bar so that people can put their legs underneath because the meal required a bit of gymnastics to fit comfortably. Other issue, but one I can forgive is that the 3 people next to me were asked what they wanted to drink, Koolaid, and somehow I became temporarily invisible and wasn't. Took about 5 minutes for anyone to bother to ask. I can't blame though because the place was busy and I who doesn't want a new place to be successful when the food and atmosphere are good.
Ordered the Betty Boop (chicken and waffle, and so did the 3 other people next to me...I have that effect on people). Chicken breast and waffle were delicious and I definitely had a sugar high from the 2 gallons of Koolaid that were served to me. I'll make a note to maybe go for some Diet Coke next time.

-it's cheap
-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)
-there is plenty to choose from on the menu
-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...

That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.

I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!

That puts me in a weird head space, review wise. While this hotel is only three years old, it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70's. I hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway, I hear people walking down the hallway above mine, and for the past two days, the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm. 

Normally I'm pretty lenient about things like that but, c'mon. This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you're trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It's a little tough under the current conditions.

Aside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It's located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There's a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.

Anyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt's business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a ""restaurant"" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin's around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there's a Chipotle around the corner. I didn't see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?

The rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors. Fancy. I'm used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it's all cloth anyway.

If they could get the sound issues fixed (lucky me, I'm on the side of the hotel NOT facing the freeway) I'd easily give another star. Proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad, but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby. There's plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago.

One definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and, of course, dead. You can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers, staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat. Hmmm... I wonder.

I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.) 

Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.

I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?

It was PACKED! But I digress.

As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)

You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.

Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!

My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc. 

The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!!

They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention. 

On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $15 - $20 for most entrees.

The aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international. 

I really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lee's.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items won't be so close to their expiration date. 

Final points:
- check expiration dates before purchasing
- Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  It's a market, not a dollar store
- If you can get past the initial fish smell, you won't be disappointed.",review,JkyvCg99SMdfS6OZv2P3RQ,0,3,0,15

The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. 

Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. 

I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. 

As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated. 

The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.

The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.

Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.

Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.

Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.",review,K_gNqlirV0kppqCGnfGiOQ,0,1,0,15

The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for ""Cha Shu Ramen"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)

The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some ""roadhouses."" 

Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.

It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.

If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)

I think it's too small for groups over six.

Maybe we'll see you there.

Added 11/18/07
I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for ""Hakata Ramen."" For extra pork, ask for ""Cha-shu-men"" or ""Cha-shu-ramen.""

yTVafrqgxkWrtUqr5yEg8Q,2010-12-14,qEiGnUUGu6qr_LY1G9uBfQ,5,"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....

Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled ""dentists for anxious patients"", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.

I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.

Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!

While the teachers were very knowledgeable in their trade, the program and administration is less than desirable. When I first toured the school and started classes in January, I was promised many things to learn, one of them being makeup classes. Still to this day they do not have those classes available at the school, and those were pretty big reasons to why I wanted to go there.
There was also a lot of drama in the midst of my schooling there. Several administrators left, a teacher left, and they changed everything that we were used to. They started focusing on advertising instead of getting students product to use, and there was a lot of times when school product would go missing when they didn't go missing before the administration change.
besides those things, the school is okay. At the very least, it will teach you what  you need to know to be an aesthetician in the state.

Another great authentic dish is their Cecca- you can get it as a ""Pie"" (Pizza, that is) or over pasta. You just have try it. It's rich, refreshing, and explosively flavorful all at once.

I've found myself putting black pepper on the mac and cheese to spice it up and haven't been all that impressed with the rest of their sides either. I'm a big fan of sides at BBQ places, even more than the meat, so when sides disappoint I get sad. :(

*willing to accommodate food allergens- I've vegan, and super lactose intolerant.
*beautifully decorated restaurant, well plated food.
*the food is made to order, even the sauces.
*I liked some of the inventive touches in their food- my curry with peas, pumpkin, baby corn.
*one of our companions asked for extra sauce and they very kindly made more

Cons:
*Portions are ridiculously small for the price.  Everyone at our table of 9 ordered a separate entree, and no own was full, even the ones who got appetizers.
*My throat was killing me, so I asked for some warm water, instead of iced, while I looked over the menu- they brought back water that was colder than room temp, without the ice and I was politely informed that this is what they had.  But I wonder how in the world they serve hot tea on the menu, if they don't have hot water in the kitchen.  
*Some of the veggies in my curry were undercooked (think aldente potato)

All in all the flavor of the food was good, but 1 cup of rice and 1.5 cups of curry does not a 18 dollar entree make. You really are paying for the ambience and customer service.

Firstly, their Czech seed beads are the cheapest in town.  I'm not even kidding.  I purchased six half tubes and one full for around $10.  The organization thereof leaves something to be desired, but at those prices, browsing should be a joy.  

Their pressed glass and fire polished selections were of average number and price.  

In the Swavorski department, standard bicones, cubes and rounds are not available as singles- only some of the pendant materials, and even then, some come packed two to a bag.  I was a bit vexed by this.  What if someone wants one Baroque for a pendant?

The back sported a nice assortment of findings and stringing materials.  Particularly impressive: a display of natural copper items ready for raiding.  Sales bins occupied the front- some bags currently up for less than a quarter.  

I found the clerk on duty during my visit was more of the hands-off type, but quite personable when I checked out.

In the time since then, their attempts to improve the airport, transportation and parking, and terminals have made it extremely confusing. Get in the wrong lane and you'll end up in the parking garage, when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the Departures curb. 

Terminal 2 remains the most accessible, with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there. Because only a couple airlines now use this terminal, security is a breeze. However, it's the oldest terminal, smells bad (like rotten pizza) and doesn't appear clean. 

Terminal 3 a little more of a hassle, although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator. More airlines use this terminal and it's much smaller than Terminal 4, making it easier to navigate.

Oh, Terminal 4. You're so nice, new and clean. You have access to great restaurants like Flo's Shanghai Cafe, Einstein's, Quizno's and more.

The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal. We started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great, although small (3 scallops/$13). How bout one more tasty morsel? Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the ""great"" category were the side dishes!

NLwjvGh628IcuGGPpqirNg,2010-03-12,r1BRTbYj6E0hho0yd-Xt1Q,2,"When I bought my house a year ago, it came with a big, half-dead front lawn.  I decided to do a desert landscape out there instead, & called a number of landscape contractors I found here on Yelp & also at the Home & Garden Show at the fairgrounds.

I soon learned that this is an unprofessional industry overall.  I had several company representatives never return my call to set up an appointment to come over & do a survey.  I had others schedule an appointment & not show up.  I had others come & do the initial survey but never get back in touch with me with a price.  One guy I called said he would look at my yard on Google Earth & email me a survey.  (He never did, & I guess a $3500 job didn't make it worth his while to come over for a few minutes!)  I had a couple of others who got back in touch but with only a materials list.  I had asked for a sketch of what they would DO with my yard for all this money!  After probably more than a dozen tries, I finally had 3 legitimate, complete surveys in hand to decide between, & the price range only varied about $500.

One of my surveys was from Tom Baird at Creative Environments.  After the survey, he emailed me a materials list & a CAD drawing that gave me a good idea what my new yard would look like.  I liked it, so I went with them.  Next, though, my job got handed off to another company rep, David Inness.  David was likable, but the job ended up changing considerably from the agreement I had with Mr. Baird.  For instance, I was promised that a BobCat skip loader would be used to dredge down 4"" to remove the old grass before the new materials were applied.  That & other promises were not fulfilled.

On installation day, three workers (& no ""Foreman Chico"" whom I was promised would be here) came out to do the work.  They didn't remove the grass at all, but rather put down some black plastic material over about HALF (!) of the yard.  I complained, & one of the workers called Chico on his cell phone & handed it to me.  Chico explained to me that they weren't going to dig down, or put down any more plastic, unless I wanted to go to the hardware store & buy some more myself!  I tried to call David Inness, but he was unreachable.

The materials included a big pile of dirt & a big pile of gravel to be used for the job.  The workers hand shoveled the dirt to form the contoured mounds as planned, but then only applied a very thin coating of the gravel on top, leaving most of the big pile on the driveway, AND LEFT!  That was it, they told me, & that I could use the rest of the tons of gravel that I had bought in planters around the place, or if I wanted, they would have it picked up in a couple days!

After trying to call for a day or two, I finally reached David Inness, who got the workers to come back over & finish applying the gravel, which they did, but unevenly.  The gravel depth ended up being zero to 3"" deep.  I moved it around some myself to even it up, but I shouldn't have had to, & since I didn't get the dig-down preparation, the gravel was already skating out onto the surrounding driveway & sidewalk.  David had the workers now dig down a little around the edges, so that the top of the gravel would be down about an inch to stay put better.

This was the worst contractor experience I have ever had in my life.  The only thing saving it from a 1-Star rating is that the nice plan for the layout of the dirt & plants was followed, & the yard does look good now.  Of course I have a problem with grass coming up through the gravel, since it wasn't scooped out as promised.  (I attempted to kill it ahead of time with weed & grass killer as directed, but all my estimators told me you really need to do both.)

If I had it to do over, I would have gone with Michael at Breese Landscaping instead.",review,ikm0UCahtK34LbLCEw4YTw,3,7,2,15

My friends and I stayed downstairs for the majority of the night. The hip hop music was pretty good and the DJ had a excellent music selection. The bartenders were very friendly, except for one of the blonde girls. When I put my empty beer bottle on the bar, she took it and I raised my hand to say ""thank you"" for taking it. Then she came back with another beer that I didn't order, and I think she got a little pissed because she misunderstood me. At the end of the night, I asked for some water and she only gave me a bottle instead of just a cup of tap water and charged me $2. Don't be a hater lady!!

GET A SHOT OF CAFE PATRON!!! If you like coffee and patron, it's literally the best of both worlds. And, to top it all off, they are only $3 A SHOT!! Very reasonably priced. I had 3 within a span of an hour (I'm a heavyweight so I wouldn't recommend that for everyone!)

Although this cozy restaurant is located in a strip mall in Tempe, the African art, woven baskets, and boxes of Harar in the hall (Ehtiopian Lager, which is delicious!) give you a small sense that you have stepped into another world.

This illusion stays well preserved as you peruse the menu and realize you have never seen anything like it, starting with your inability to pronounce ""Yekik Alicha"" (split peas).

But do not be daunted by this new territory.  Start your adventure to Ethiopia with the ""Yekemem Shai,"" a black tea with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves.  If you are new to Ethiopian, and not sure what to get, the Lalibela Exclusive is the most fantastic combination of dishes you can sample.  Here, you will have a smattering of meat and vegetarian dishes ranging from ""Yebeg Alicha Sega Wat"" (lamb cubes simmered in kibae, onion, turmeric and herbs) to my personal fave, the ""Yekik Alicha"" (split peas cooked with onion, turmeric and herbs).

Once the food arrives, the basket of ""injera"" (bread closely resembling a crepe) will become your eating utensils.  Don't be shy, tear off a piece, and use it to scoop the delicious morsels off the plate and into your expectant mouth.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact, you may feel as though you have just stepped off University and into a traveling caravan in the Ethiopian desert.

Whether you are a carniverous adventurer, or a vegetarian swashbuckler - you will enjoy the richness and flavors of this unique cuisine. Bring a large appetite, as the food is quite filling.  Dominant meats are beef, chicken and lamb.  Savory veggies to be enjoyed are lentils, peas, cabbages, and collard greens.

For a lovely gustative to finish your meal, order a glass of the traditional Ethiopian sweet wine made from honey.

Overall, from the service to the food, to the ambiance, an excellent place to bring friends, or a date ;)",review,HjhR3u17OjxD4s8t3toTfg,2,3,0,15

However, I would say that it's not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. It's the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals.

If you're in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals.",review,HZ3ItZ23xZHqjUjRIdPi7Q,2,1,0,15
