Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.",review,EP3cGJvYiuOwumerwADplg,1,1,1,8

Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.

For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!

I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.

Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- 
"" No problem "" we were told , come on down. 

arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- 

Note to the great state of Arizona : 

(the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) .

we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that "" he had already set a table for us inside""- 

upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio  he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. 

this puzzled my wife who then surmised that : 

A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio

B) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill 
                                      ( there was) 
                 
after taking our drink order ,(competently),  he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types ""hot "" or ""regular""-
there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared  to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -??  the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...???

when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied: 
"" I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food"" 

????????????????? 

Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? 

The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding.

The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold--

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.",review,n9Zg0jlOGtxfIrvoPm6Hhw,4,6,3,8

It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather.

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...

then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.

i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. 

we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.

My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say.

It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  

I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!",review,DOJM58OkGSsIdk2qCUZnLQ,0,0,0,8

I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! 

A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. 

POSITIVE: 

Our waitress was very friendly and chipper. 

NEGATIVE: 

But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the ""shot glass"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. 

The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... 

1) we never got our edamame, 

2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... 

3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. 

POSITIVE: 

She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. 

NEGATIVE: 

No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. 

Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. 

And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... 

POSITIVE: 

For the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last).",review,2KNPtV5E44vAiEr5BvMkUA,3,2,4,8

It was just over 10 bucks for a cheeseburger, regular fries, and large drink. The food was excellent.  I ding it down to 4 stars though, just because anything this good has to be unhealthy, and its definitely greasy.   The grease from the fries saturday my brown paper take-out bag.  They also squished the top of my bun pretty bad when wrapping it up in tin foil.  I'm guessing if you eat there, you don't have this problem as much.  Still, 4 stars for an excellent burger and fries place.  Definitely a step up over In-N-Out.",review,L-O1rmPXJ3ihCnfgJIigbQ,0,0,0,8

This time, the chicken pieces seems to be a little bit bigger than last time. The menu now has a disclaimer saying that some sides may incur an additional charge.  That was two of my gripes on my first visit, so check and check.. 

This time, I ordered an 8pc with 2 large sides...As stated above, chicken was bigger, and it was hot and moist..perfectly seasoned. For sides, I ordered the sweet corn nuggets and mac and cheese. They had run out of mac and cheese and had to make more. It took about 10 minutes to make. Was it worth the wait? It was fresh, REAL macaroni and cheese, baked in the oven, not some ""out of the box"" variety. It was made with real cheese, as witnessed by the stringy cheese when eaten. My comment here is that I prefer a more creamy variety than what it was. But it definitely was better than Kraft mac & cheese in a box. 

The sweet corn nuggets were incredible. Not sure if they are something they make fresh or if it comes out of a freezer bag, but they were delicious little morsels. Nuggets of corn kernals, surrounded by a light crunchy coating and deep fried. 

I wanted to try out their fried shrimp, so I got an ""add on"" of 4 fried shrimp ($1.99). At first view, I was disappointed. What I got were 4 very small (think MAYBE 45-50 sized shrimp). They were not even butterflied, which would have made them appear bigger). But upon tasting them, I really enjoyed the flavor. They appeared to be freshly breaded (is it the same seasoned flour used for the chicken?) and were very tasty. My suggestion here would be to 1) butterfly the shrimp and 2) get a slightly larger shrimp (even if it means a price increase).
 
With my second trip to LFC, I am becoming an even bigger fan..Tasty chicken, good sides, a clean restaurant, and nice employees.",review,cFoiVWF42HSXQEtqxDvdWQ,1,1,1,8

Do you suppose they have problems with segregation/integration?  You know, the  tomatoes CLAIM that the bagels could have moved into the produce department if they had CHOSEN to; they just CHOSE to occupy shelf space in the bakery department because they LIKED being with their own kind?  Doesn't a bathroom cleaning product have the same rights to locate itself in a freezer case as a gelato does if that's what its little heart desires?  Do the canned yams believe that there is nothing wrong with the candy in the bulk food section, they just wouldn't want THEIR daughter to marry one?  I almost wanted to stick a carrot in the dairy section just to make the point.  NO MORE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL around here.  Nope, we're a modern day non-bigotted ""everybody deserves a fair shot around here"" kind of grocery store.

Well, I finally had the occasion to stop in here over the the weekend I was visiting Phoenix and was surprised to discover it catered to a mainly Hispanic customer base.  Being from Bakersfield, California, this made me feel at home at once!  There was mariachi music playing over the PA system, and there were spanish language entertainment magazines by the checkout.  

I stopped in because a friend texted me to pick up a bottle of Pinot Grigio for her.  Now, I know that those of you who shop here regularly are probably still rolling on the floor laughing, but remember - I'm from out of state and didn't know any better.  When I discovered their tiny wine section, and that it was mostly Carlo Rossi & Gallo wine, I was momentarily downcast.  But there, on the very top shelf, were a few varietals by a decent Australian Wine Cellar and - Lo and behold - one lonely Pinot Grigio.  Ta - da!  Cue cherubs descending Earthward blowing trumpets in celebration.  And to make it even more exciting IT WAS ON SALE!  Yes, normally priced at $7.99 a bottle, they were on sale for $5.99 each.  I decided to bring her two bottles just to celebrate.

The checker was very friendly and spoke English with only a minimal accent so bonus there, too.  The final kicker was when I gave my friend the receipt she discovered they'd only charged me $4.99 per bottle. Woohoo!

Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area.

As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.
 
Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    
 
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.
 
Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!
 
So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy.

I showed up today (Sunday) and was a little thrown off by all the people at the bag drop wearing football jerseys. Especially when the people wearing jerseys were the ones grabbing my clubs and putting them in a cart. Thought I was at Buffalo Wild Wings! 

I thought this was a very nice course but the reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it just didn't have that top notch feel that other Troon managed properties have. The greens were very inconsistent; some really fast, some really slow, and some were bumpy. The grass on gold was extremely long and it was very easy to lose your ball in the rough because the grass was so deep. Blue was cut much better but I had a couple complaints with holes 7 and 9. If you're playing the blue course in the late afternoon, you might as well close your eyes while teeing off at 7 and 9 because the architect made the course so you look directly into the sun. 

I sneaked on today for $44 bucks and was very satisfied with what I got for the price. If I didn't live 15 miles away, and could always get on for $40 I'd probably golf here a lot more. If the green fees are above $50, I just couldn't justify it with all the other nice options around the valley. 

On a final note, I was EXTREMELY impressed by the staff and how friendly they were. I was not only asked how my round of golf went, I was also told how glad they were that I came out, and finally that they really hope to see me again.

Their service is great! You will be greeted from the time that you step a foot through their door. Unfortunately, per today's so-called standards this is not a very common courtesy. 

If you a first time customer or a returning customer, you can ask the person behind a counter to recommend a meal for you or you can ask for a minute or five. As a very indecisive person when it comes to choosing an item from a menu... I really, REALLY appreciate it when I do not feel rushed when it comes to making such an important decision in my overwhelmed life. :P

I haven't tried too many things from their menu because I usually stick to my favorite: Award Winning Gyro Lunch/ Dinner. A plate of delicious slices of beef and lamb, carved off the rotisserie, served with fresh toasted pita.

Lunch is served with your choice of the sides... Oh, and did I mentioned that their prices are extremely affordable! $5-$13 price range!!

So, enjoy your meal and make sure that you do get a chance to turn around as you are walking out because they WILL thank you for coming!

So no, Boombozz is definitely not the best pizza that I've ever had, but for their style of pizza, they are pretty good. Think traditional Domino's/Papa John's type crust with stepped-up, unique toppings and sauce. My husband said the crust tasted like a cheesy breadstick, and I think that's a pretty accurate description. We got the D'Sienna with an interesting tomato cream sauce, spinach, and tomatoes. The low quality cheese detracted from it overall, but it was still much better than the pizza at Oregano's.

Update:

Went for lunch:   This time I thought the corned beef taquitos even  better than last, curry chips tad saltier.  Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.   This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return
 

Original Review:
 First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. 
Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. 

Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  
Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   
 
The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. 

Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  

Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. 

Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.

Were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.     The jukebox played ""i'm too sexy "" by Right said fred  WTF that really  messed up the ambience.Country bars don't have NIN on the box after all.",review,N3L6SDymSRkYQtTiSDmXSg,3,3,2,8
ujLZmyy11g1JHCQTxRA3Dw,2012-04-22,NeLthtGs80ad0BFE7yjv0w,3,"I don't know why I waited so long to try this place when it is literally right around the corner from my house.  I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.

We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much ""wrapper"" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.

I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well.",review,VPXgY9lGJF3XC4ZpusxNuA,2,3,1,8

Whole Foods Market.
Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today. 
But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as:

*crow's feet
*saddlebags
*sagging butt and or tits, 
*and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in.

You've got a choice to make.

Spend all your money now on organic, free range shit, this in an effort to remain healthy looking, or, shop for a lot of the same stuff at Costco, where you can load up, get twice your money's worth, and have a shitload of cardboard boxes you won't have a clue what to do with. 

But the real bonus will be how in only a few short years, you'll have saved enough money for a good plastic surgeon, which you're going to need anyway if you have any plans to remain living in Scottsdale for any length of time.

My opinion?
I highly recommend the latter and here's why.

Scottsdale has a serious shortage of fish-lipped women with feline looking facial features, who routinely wear yoga pants telegraphing their hiked-up thongs. 
Poor thong....how sad that your fate...to be cast to a fifty-something, saggy-butt host.
Ladies, is that what you want?
To idly standby, watching, as the ranks of this bass-cat looking oddity dwindle in population?
I didn't think so.

The choice is yours.
Beautiful and broke from shopping at Whole Foods today.
Or, aging not so gracefully with the help of medical science, an overzealous plastic surgeon, and Victoria's Secret, which I assure you with one of her thongs in yoga pants will be anything but. 
A lot of good all that free range organic crap did. 

If you do come here, try the hot deli, where you can get every kind of ethnic food, save for Ethiopian. It helps after a late night at work, on your way home, when you don't feel like eating fast food. They also have a taco and pizza bar, fresh bakery, and a smoked meats section where you can get some of the worst barbecue and smoked meats I've ever tasted. 
The only thing I'll recommend in this place other than the hot deli, is the chocolate and coffee bar, which seems to have a ton of delights that are supposedly good for you.

Uh, okay, what have you slackers been doing for the hour that you've been open this morning?  Fast forward to yesterday, when we decided to give it another go.  We showed up about 45 minutes after they opened, desperately wanting a Bloody Mary.  Guess what?  The bartender hadn't showed up yet...we were walking out to go elsewhere (we REALLY wanted a Bloody Mary--don't judge) when she did arrive and we popped over and ask if she could make them--then we would have sat back down and had breakfast.  Nope, she said, she needed 15 minutes to get set up.  It wasn't the 15 minute wait that made us leave--we had to drive somewhere else, after all--but her response sent us to the door.

Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. 

For dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting ""real Chinese"" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.

From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. 

With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. 

In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. 

A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. 

The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   

Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. 

Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean.

Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close. 
It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!!

Very contemporary. Lovely. We were in building C and overlooked the rose/aroma garden which was quite quiet and pretty. Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less.
- Pools were the best. We swam in the main south pool, the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well. Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell you...night swimming rules! We rarely get to do where I live.

I selected the cab to go with the RF ""Big Ass Burger,"" even though I wanted to try the zin.  Did I choose wrong?  I'll try the zin next time.

Since I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).

But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! 

Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.

 Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.

There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. 

The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. 

I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!",review,kNzDEbEdnbdFgnaYD8r6nw,0,1,0,8
k6Si433-EJrY4J7SZxsnjA,2012-02-24,kEBSBvCgJ70qjZTTwzBYKQ,4,"Strolled in with a posse of 14 people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.

First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.

In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef ""medium"" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.

For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. 

The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded.

Came here on 12/23 evening close to 7pm.  Parked the car right in front and seemed no one was in there. It turned out they were closing early that night.  The menu was small and don't offer much explanation (I guess they figure everyone knows what's taco and burro) 

Place was clean but smelled like smoke when we walked in. 

Looking at the price, I figure the taco was small and confirmed with the big, tall white tattoo guy behind the cashier, so I know how many to order.  My parents wanted fish tacos (they only know Rubio's fish tacos and burritos *roll eyes*) and I ordered some al pastor and asada tacos.  Since I am from LA, I am spoiled with cheap, good tacos.  The ones from Tacos Atoyas was only a okay compare to the ones in LA.   Usually the tacos I have are overflow with meat, but these are only half way filled.  Taste was a okay too.  

They also ran out of beef tamale that night which my dad wanted to try.

Things I've tried there:

LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.

Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!

Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.

We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.

So last night my fiance and I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we headed over. When I ordered my steak cooked medium, I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week.

When our food came out, she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted. I did and, while it was a bit more medium-well than medium, I was hungry and it looked good, so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal. It really was a good steak.

When our waitress came out again, she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly. I assured her it was fine. A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it. I assured him it was maybe a little overdone, but it was good and I was happy with my meal. They were being very nice and showing some great customer service, though a little overzealous. :)

When the bill came, they had made my steak the free one for the coupon, even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered.

I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.

You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. 

On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.

The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch.

Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.

Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. 

The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.",review,BncUtrl2bphVTu12y5fTlQ,0,1,0,8

The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill. 

The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl. 

There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. 

Free-range and refills on beverages. 

Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well.

However, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff.  I was mistreated.  I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was ""Are you a guest here?""  Followed by ""because we get a lot of people around here...""  While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk.  This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.  Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool.  

Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk.  There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc.  I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no.  It had been misplaced.  Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener.  Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. 

Regardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me.  I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against.  It's a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card.

We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level.  Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard's Pie. The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well. If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it's the best I've ever had. If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs. Or if you are you are up to it go with both.

When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate! It could be scorching bloody hot. Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well, just stay clam it will cool soon enough. 

When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert. By now you will feel very full, I know, I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it.

I remember enjoying full pints of St.Berardus Christmas Ale at happy hour prices as well as other ""high gravity"" options that were served in normal glasses.  Now they're in smaller glasses that look like a highball or rocks glass, but the price isn't smaller.   When I go in prime dining hours somehow 3 of us can rack up a tab exceeding $100 and it just seems a bit extreme for pizza 'n beers.  This isn't the Biltmore or Kierland.  It's a very middle class area and I'm not sure how the prices are a good match for folks who live nearby and dine here.

But it's not just the prices I guess.  It seems like a lot of the servers are not happy and give attitude, and I'm a very polite person in public so I know it wasn't me. 

At the bar last winter I've chatted with a guy who knows a lot about beer but lately it seems the bartenders are just attractive females who don't really know craft beer, and the overall demographic in the bar isn't the same.  Call me an old fart, but I'd rather talk about West Coast beers than have all the eye candy.

In the interest of supporting local AZ businesses, my husband and I had dinner here on my b-day (5/13). The first thing I observed is that they have a couple walk-up windows on the southside of the building so you can place your order and get food without having to go inside. Thought that was pretty clever! We arrived close to 8 pm and it was still pretty busy inside, but the line moved quickly. 

The restaurant is set up cafeteria style with a kitschy country look. There is a huge mural on one wall dedicated to farm living and a John Deere tractor with accompanying bric-a-brac on the other side. Once we got through the line, I choose the meat plate with 2 sides...beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats, mac 'n' cheese and beans for my sides. I really wanted to get chicken instead of the pork, but they had unfortunately run out of chicken :( . My hubby got the full slab of pork ribs with sweet cut corn and mac 'n' cheese for his sides. We shared a piece of cornbread and for dessert, split the root beer cake. Happily I received a discount on my meal because it was my birthday (they advertise a ""free"" meal, though it's basically $10 off).

The beef brisket and pulled pork were so good! Tender, juicy, and delicious! Those meats really are the best reason to go Joe's. The beans and mac 'n' cheese were just ok...so far Fleming's beats everyone hands down when it comes to mac 'n' cheese! The cornbread was so-so, tasted like it came from a box, but the honey butter that comes with it made it pretty tasty. Regrettably, my husband's pork ribs were pretty fatty as compared to Lucille's (Tempe Marketplace). The root beer cake was good, but not as delectable as we thought it would be. Maybe we were expecting too much after reading how much fellow Yelpers enjoyed it? Another thing worth mentioning (some others have commented on it too) is how strange the beverage station is. It's smack dab at the front of the line where you get your food so you have to fight your way through the crowd (if there is one) to get a refill. Weird.   

To conclude, Lucille's is still our #1 favorite place for BBQ, but we would still go to Joe's again.",review,_qQJEA45k_E6EGE7vuzUDA,0,0,0,8

There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?

Apparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.

Things improved dramatically since the last time I went. Firstly, our server wasn't an upsell machine. In fact, she was very polite and concerned about our order (Mine was particularly attentive with replacing and putting on the side of some ingredients, and she and the staff double-checked with me before and afterward to make sure everything was hunky-dory). The food was great, as always; had my first MM calzone, and I actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have. 

No mention of this in my first reviews, as I don't recall going to the bathroom, but their bathroom is great! Ha, maybe TMI for a food review; however, really impressed with the privacy of the stalls.

Back to more relevant things, I was confused (though I suppose not off-put) about the happy hour rules (we went after 10, which is advertised as HH); apparently it isn't half-price appetizers on some nights and instead is a slice of pepperoni or something for $3? Not sure I call that a deal, but I guess beers being half-off makes up for it.

I was kind of disappointed they didn't have Fall Woodchuck as I went during their fall-themed beers time, but I guess it's kinda a pussy beer anyway (I'll qualify myself by saying I'm more of a straight liquor guy, but Woodchuck is my guilty pleasure). The waitress had a nifty hand-written updated list she kept with her, and while I'm not a beer man I can appreciate the effort in something like that.

Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.

I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.

Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).

As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.

This is another one of those places that thrives on the Groupon phenomenon. Prices are jacked up to accommodate a discount. I bought a $6.50 bottle of beer (as one example). My pizza, a sausage pie, came out burned. I know that a good pizza has a ""flame kissed"" look to it, even at top places like Bianco's. But this pie was flame-licked, and there's a difference. I tasted charcoal more than I did sausage. 

The folded and stuffed Calzone was not burned, but neither was it stuffed so full that it's busting its seams which is the way we like it. Lots of air inside this Calzone. I'lll take the dramatically less expensive Calzone at Mama Mia's on Indian School any day over this hot-air filled version.

The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.

The trail is mostly paved on the east side of the canal and pea gravel hard pack on the west side.  It runs along subdivisions, golf courses and even a couple farms.  The grade is very gentle throughout.  I would consider the trail primarily for use by joggers, bicyclists and equestrians.

There is parking at the address listed for the trail and nearby parking at Tumbleweed Recreation Center at McQueen and Germann.  There is also easy to find street parking near many of the junctions with major streets.  A good southern starting point is off of Riggs Rd. between Arizona and McQueen.  There is plenty of street parking.  From here the ride north is mostly a slight uphill ride, making the return trip a nice relaxing roll.

One issue with the trail is crossings with major streets.

We were surprised at how busy they were on a Tuesday night, but we were able to snag a table on their beautiful covered patio. The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of 5 with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu.

We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!

For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Here's where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring. 

So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.

When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.

We boxed everything up and ordered the huckleberry bread pudding to go. I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didn't reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey.

Overall, i loved the food and the staff was really apologetic bout the ""incident"". The atmosphere is great and i would definitely come back. Next time, the burger!",review,rBeuXzsBkGxM5pJujH2zAQ,1,1,1,8
bts6jVczHJuWzpT8Y26UsQ,2009-03-18,aDBncnQvoMB9jh7_kFpBEA,3,"I've got alot of nice and not-so-nice things to say about Phoenix's latest venture into building serious public transportation.

Nice Thing #1: Mainly because it's new, the cars are really clean. After living in LA and using the metro subway there, anything seems cleaner than that. Let's just hope they keep up the cleanliness of the light rail in the years to come.

Nice Thing #2: It gets me from A to B with little to no problems. It gets the job done. Also, it's one of Phoenix's more serious efforts at going green, so it's worth backing.

Nice Thing #3: All of the current downtown stops are well thought out. Once you step off, something is always walking distance.

Nice Thing #4: The price of the all-day pass is worth it.

Nice Thing #5: Unlike public transportation in LA, the light rail is generally on time and makes for a reliable means of getting around. There don't seem to be any car companies that are trying to choke-hold the city by shutting any stations down like they did in the 30's in LA.

The cons...

Bad Thing #1: The only logic in taking the light rail is that it's essentially a car you don't have to park or fill up on gas. It's not that it's slow, but it really only goes slightly faster than the cars driving next to it in the street. Part of the sluggishness of the light rail stems from the fact that it has to stop at traffic lights like the cars you decided not to drive. I think the smarter idea would've been to build the light rail above or under ground so it could have gone faster and not have to stop at lights or risk the chance of some idiot gunning it and T-boning one of the passenger cars.

Bad Thing #2: I know this experiment is still in its training wheels stage, but I really wish that they would build a line that would go to North Phoenix, Scottsdale, or Glendale. I've heard that they are planning a Glendale route, but that's probably going to take another ten years. Even though I live a few blocks from one of the stops, I really wish I wasn't limited to downtown, Tempe, or Mesa.

Bad Thing #3: No airport stop? I mean, there is, but you have to take a shuttle to the actual airport. Why not just build a stop there? It would make more sense.

Bad thing #4: Why does this thing shut off at 11? Is Phoenix trying to kill any chance of building a real nightlife downtown? We're not children. This city shouldn't set a curfew before midnight on this.

In all, the Valley Metro Rail is more yay than nay. It's got its kinks that it still needs to work out and it's kinda tough to judge something that's in what I hope is a very nascent form of what it will eventually become.",review,FxxYCRPcpd__yhRRmmtyMQ,2,1,1,8

I had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate.

The meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right.

The chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy/underdone, not squishy/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form.

Minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasn't thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it ain't green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board.

There's nothing special about Winco.  It's your typical grocery.  I'm not a savvy coupon clipper or price matcher so I cannot attest to the savings to be had at Winco.  A thrifty shopper I know claims the savings are to be had.

That said there are two negatives that shine brightly at Winco: credit cards not accepted and cheap bags.

Do not come here if your earnings are running low.  I just gathered my weekly groceries and expected to charge 'em.  Not a surprise I was looking forward to after waiting in the long lines.

On my first visit most of the bags were torn up the seam and the handles were split.  For one reason or another the cashier actually helped bag my haul.  How she could hand over bags so blatantly ripped is beyond me.

On the plus side, Winco stocks Shasta Tiki Punch.

Winco isn't a terrible place but I don't see any reason to jettison Fry's and Target (unless I'm in the mood for Tiki Punch).

ABrSt3fsirLrUYNVrD3fbQ,2009-09-10,tBBloQyqI_B0If7ShHt49A,3,"I've been to the Greene House many times. In general, I think it's pretty good. I go mostly for lunch, and I order from the sandwiches & salads typically.Tonight was no different - had a sandwich.

I went with my brother as a belated bday celebration. Ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. Had the pineapple rum cake for dessert.

The first few times I ate at the Greene House, I was really impressed. I thought the food and service was very good. Over time, I've become less impressed. Tonight, the service was great - loved my server. Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Good coordination between the staff, and we were kept well supplied throughout dinner.

The food is not consistent. That's a big issue I have with restaurants in general. Maybe I'm harsh, but I really believe being inconsistent knocks a place down a few notches. The problem with inconsistency is that you don't know what you're going to get. If a place is consistently mediocre, at least I know I'm going to get mediocre.

Tonight the real downer to the whole meal was the salad. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was not great either - bun too big compared to the amount of meat and other filling items on the sandwich, not enough meat - but the side salad was really awful. First, if I moved the salad on my plate, there was a big pool of dressing on my plate. There is such a thing as a properly dressed salad, and this was not it. Way too much dressing. I might have been ok with that had the dressing been very good... which it wasn't. The balsamic dressing was too sweet, and was under seasoned (definitely needed more salt).

The dessert was good. It wasn't great... but it was good. The rum cake, in my opinion, was too dry. Maybe the ridiculously large scoop of gelato is supposed to compensate for that, but I'd prefer a more moist cake and less gelato. I'm also not a huge fan of places where the dessert is almost as big (if not bigger) than the entree. Give me a couple bites of something amazing rather than a huge plate of something mediocre. I felt that this dessert fell into the later category.

I'm going to admit that this is only the second time I've ever had dessert at The Greene House, so I won't pass judgement on it's entire dessert menu, but I'll say the couple times I've been there, the dessert/entree ratio was way out of whack for my liking.",review,Oz0XuMILEjSFoQ8na4k0Wg,1,1,1,8

The soup was actually pretty good.  My wife and I liked it much better.  

The only thing we think they could have done better is the following:

Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals.

After finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Lo's would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire year's worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist. 

We had a short wait for our table, but were able to quench our thirst on soft drinks, punch, and sweet tea. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to love it. 

I am a big fan of chicken. I am a big fan of waffles. Yet, I have never had them together. Thus, I decided the only choice for me was their No. 1 Meal, called KK's. Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. 

The food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big ""fried chicken"" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear.

Well stocked and friendly staff.
I don't normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look.
That's when Border's became one of my fave places.
I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD.
I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before.
I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness.
For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for.
I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in.
Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at.
I bought that too!

Good:  I can't get enough of the Cape Cod salad! It is really somethin' special, that ain't no lie.  Also the soup is always flavorful.

Bad: Has nothing to do with the food. It is all about the atmosphere, which is oppressive in an I'm-so-unique-and-talented-and-you-are-smelly-dung sort of way. Staff is pretentious and lazy. They think they must be pretty lofty individuals for working there but that doesn't mean they LIKE to work, for god's sake....  The owner. She is somewhat friendly, but beware. She is the person who created this environment, and it becomes easy to believe once she starts bragging about how well-off she is.  So congratulations everyone! We support these immature little weasels who scorn this gross human ritual we indulge ourselves in: being a customer, AND apparently we have made the owner a rich woman but shhhhhh! She's still the kewlest of the kewl.

UPDATE: Received an annoying email from the owner (the husband) who instructed me give "" *constructive criticism* "" and not make a personal attack or be petty. My review was neither of those things. I do not know John, nor do I know Carla. I only know what I experience when I have lunch at their place of business. The staff was rude and lazy. The owner DID brag. The food I always order is good. Get a grip buddy.

I was honest about my experience for OTHER PEOPLE who are considering spending their cash on food there.  I am not in the least concerned about the owners or the staff personally, but apparently John thinks I ought to be.  I ought to see how great Carla is. In fact, he goes into detail about how great Carla is.  It's nice to witness a man standing up for his lady. It would almost cause me to add a star up there, but sorry, no can do.  His improper use of the possessive apostrophe SEVERAL times canceled that out (okay, now that was petty -my bad).  

I'd advise John to concentrate on things other than trolling around yelp, chastising his own customers, whose business supports that fancy paint and the famously zombie-like staff.  Maybe the staff is just following John's lead when they don't focus on creating a positive experience for their customers?

Honestly, I remain puzzled as to why John would bother to bother me.  I go into a small restaurant to find the owner bragging. That is part of my experience and I will continue to post reviews featuring owners, and how they carry themselves.

As for the ""personal attack"" on Carla, I will not retract what I said just because John is butthurt and whines about it. I will say this: Carla has probably been in the restaurant several of the many times I have dined there, but I perceived the bragging only one time. I doubt anyone who read my review would label this person a braggart based on that one experience of mine, and as I said before- it did not and would not stop me from going back.

I will be back. I will order the food and enjoy the food, but since that's not the only part of the dining experience, I will tolerate the negative things because the food I regularly order is consistently good.",review,tdoL4Un5_hy_rJxEFLLOjw,3,3,4,8

Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall ""amazing"" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........

Don't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using ""local"" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. 

The hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take ""over easy"" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. 

All in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality.

First of all, their fresh sausages made from scratch daily are to die for. Even if you don't like the store overall, just go there, buy a few different sausages and grill them with 100% natural wood charcoal. (Please, do not use lighter fluid! Take a piece of bounty, soak it in some cheap olive oil and you will ignite anything)
If you see 15 different kinds of sausage and don't know which one you may like, ask for their sausage menu; there is a description and list of all ingredients.

Then lets go to their meat department. Grass fed meet. It is not something you will see at any regular store. Is it good? It is worth extra? I'm a skeptic, but I found it to be way better than a regular meat.  Grass fed ground beef was so good! We made burgers and I could definitely taste the difference. 
Grass fed filet mignon was also very nice. It was not better than USDA prime filet mignon from Costco, but it was way better than regular corn fed  filet mignon. I wish farmers would go back to the old times, when they were not controlled by 5 corporations and nobody was forcing cows to eat corn, but I digress...

Need real organic eggs and willing to pay $5 per dozen? No problem, they are here. Frankly, I could not tell that these organic eggs were way better than regular eggs for half the price, but maybe people who bake can tell the difference...

Also, if you're looking for that particular brand of sour cream, butter, kefir  (lowfat yogurt), most likely, you will find it there - they carry many different brands and it seems they do not favor one over another. 

Try organic bananas and tell me they taste the same as regular ones. They do not, they are way better, they have flavor and they are sweet. They almost taste like bananas you would get on Caribbean islands. The one they sell to you the same day they take it off the tree... when it was already yellow and ripe Try peaches and apricots from Chile. They taste like peaches and apricots. Yes, some will have marks, dents and will not look perfect, you have to select, but I rather spend 3 extra minutes picking good ones than get tasteless, but all perfectly looking fruits.

Now, bad. Of course, they do not always have best fruits and vegetables and a lot of them have a tag ""Mexico"". It is unfortunate that ""grown in Mexico"" is associated with poor produce nowadays. Mexico has a great climate and they can definitely grow tasty, pesticide free fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, the market drives demand in a capitalist economy. Many people still look for huge and cheap. Companies provide huge and cheap. Some people are poor, they don't have money to buy quality produce and overpay for organic.  It is sad, but unless we stop buying crappy produce, organic will be super expensive for a while (no competition).

These huge see through plastic bins filled with different nuts seems like a great idea at first, but way too unsanitary. People open these bins with their dirty hands, dip into them, cough and sneeze next to them and that's where you get your nuts from? No way! At least, not for me.

Fish section looks sad, which seems to be a trend in every AZ supermarket. You can find better fish in our area at Costo (huge amounts, good for big families), sometimes AJs (not always though), Mekong plaza supermarket or Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket. That's it.  if you know any other places where I can get fish which does not smell fishy, please let me know.

A lot of their organic produce, including potato is wrapped with a sticky label which says organic on every item. Ughh... it was so annoying to remove wrap around labels from every potato that at the end I didn't not care for the taste - I just wanted to finish peeling them. I guess, the store has to identify organic food somehow, but these extremely sticky labels are not a good idea. Think of something else, Sprout.

So, this Sprout store is not perfect, but I will continue visiting it every week and look forward to some  improvements in the future.",review,OfVHKs2Z3vThGnmJYHVpcg,0,2,0,8

When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies.

If you find yourself here with a wait (not always, but sometimes) look about yourself. The patrons at this location are uber friendly. With a larger-than-average number of regulars, some of them have very good stories to share, and are particularly generous. 

We waited one night and had two gentlemen with a high top table offer to let us share their space. It was a rousing good time full of mutual ease, and they left before our party of 3 had finished. When we went to pay, we found out they had taken care of the entire bill. Thanks guys!

The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.

I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?

I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).

Here is a rundown of the food:

* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top
* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.
* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.
* burger - pretty solid but nothing special
* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.
* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.

Once our eyes adjusted (it's dark inside, like any good speakeasy), I loved the decor.  It's a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make.  We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.  Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.  BOTTLES OF WINE.  I'm sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.  

We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda). Yum. We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly, apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side.  IT WAS $7.  Between the $8 bottle of wine and that, I felt like I was stealing from these people.

Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...

Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...

I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu!
Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the ""food"" review.

Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni! 
Saba...not bad...
Sweet Shrimp....foul tasting
Toro.....couldn't even bite through it
A good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that..
When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.

My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll.
Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..

Drinks:
Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.

Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms

All in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...

Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!",review,xs_fnNe0hofd7ZOupCjesQ,3,10,2,8

First of all, they have their shit together. From signs all down 60 assuring you that you're going the right way, to having a specific Ren Faire lane to a plethora of parking attendants, everything was organized perfectly.

Before I talk about the Faire itself, I have to say I was incredibly impressed at how disability accessible this place was. Between tons and tons of handicap park, ramps into each store, first aid people walking around with red cross flags so you knew where the first aid was, and even handicap reserved seating at the joust.  I give them an A+ on that.

The shops were great; found an excellent variety of things for sale.  I got a great cane, candles, incense, jewelry and more. Food was good too; lots of veggie and meat options. We got broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl (soup was ok, bread bowl was super delicious!), falafel (good), chocolate covered nut rolls (delicious!) and a good juicy pickle.   Drinks were huge for the $3 we paid, and could be found all over.

I also liked how much seating there was, both in sun and shade.  We were able to stay longer because of being able to take breaks.

The staff themselves were nice, but I didn't feel that many of them were as ""into"" their rolls as other faires I've been to.  I'd say ""good morrow"" and get ""how are you doing?"" in return.  Not a big deal, but just would have bumped it up to 5 stars.

Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.

The décor was French quarter New Orleans-themed, with Parisian style knick knacks & art work abound. A bit on the kitchy side, but quite nifty IMO! What I found to be not only impressive but wise was that they had free coffee, mini muffins & sample size nut loafs for the waiting patrons, which mostly consisted of seniors & families. 

Following the hostess to our table, I couldn't help but notice, the humongous portion size of ALL of their dishes. 

The menu had so many mouth watering choices, but considering I was feeling ill, I ordered a bowl of granola & a (YU-MMY) buttermilk spice muffin. Boring I know, but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish, the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, bacon & asiago cream sauce, accompanied by red potatoes, choice of one of their mega-sized (hot & fresh) muffins & fresh squeezed O.J. 

The service was on the slow side, perhaps understaffed or just overwhelmed, but our waiter made it up to us by giving me choice of beverage & extra muffins, no charge. 

For those of you who want healthier options, don't you fret, they offer a Fresh & Fit menu as well.

I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.

Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.

Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.

I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling.

After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor.

There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it.

The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can't make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying ""just pick one!"". Due to this fact, I've always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel. 

I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious.

The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!",review,fl6oI21uXoxVMwfR6lFanQ,0,0,0,8

They have, hands-down, the best Pollo Fundito Chimi I have ever eaten, and boy have I eaten my fair share.  5 stars

Their chips and salsa are also always fresh.  The chips get also 5 stars.  Always fresh and hot.  

Their mild salsa is very mild and watery.  Not my style but it fresh.  I mix the hot in with the mild which works form me.

Shredded beef tacos are also 5 stars.  Love 'em.

Fried ice cream is also yummy.  I'm not a desert guy so I won't attach stars to them but yum yum.

Other tips are to come at happy hour.  Good deals.  Lunch specials and portions are just right also.

Carlos O'Brien's is a great place that just gives me comfort knowing that it is there when I need it.  I spend so much time trying new places, especially mexican, that this old favorite tends to get skipped because the closest one is 15 miles from the house.

I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  

I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  

""There are two tables before you,"" I was told.  ""It will likely be another ten minutes or so."" 

At that, I responded, ""is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?""

And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:

-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!

-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?

-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.

-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.

With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!",review,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw,5,13,5,8

I picked something in the 60s with chicken and red curry. It was really delicious, with unique flavors and a good spiciness. My only difficulty was that my food was basically swimming in the sauce. I ended up packing some up to take home, and ended up with a plate still full of sauce.

I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza.  I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10.  So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket.

The good?  The garlic topping is delicious.  The employees were friendly.  They were generous with their toppings.    

The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough.  If you're off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese.  It will probably be a lot better!

The just okay?  The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry.  The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other.  

This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers.  Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10"" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin.  My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was).

I knew going in to expect items from all over the world, but there are literally instruments and related objects from every country. We spent between two and two and a half hours but it still wasn't enough time to really take in everything.

I loved that the audio/video guide was included in the $15 admission price. Most museums I have been to charge an additional fee. This was unlike any guide I have experienced before. No numbers to punch in, just walk by any of the exhibits with your headset on and when you stop at each video screen, the audio automatically starts up! Very cool, and I loved watching all the videos to learn more about all the instruments. When I walked up to the flamenco part of the Spain exhibit I instantly recognized the video playing as I have actually been in the flamenco club in Madrid where it was filmed so I thought that was neat.

I really enjoyed all of the exhibits especially seeing the ""guts"" of the Steinway piano and how Martin guitars are made. It's not something I had thought about much before but now I know so much! I think the MIM is a fab place to take kids (and adults!) to learn and to get them excited about music. Definitely check it out it you haven't yet.

Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor.

If you want to have a party for the football season, or any type of sporting event, have it here, they offer a good variety of party platters, and it's not your regular wings and potatoe skins and fried veggies and cheese thingys.  Party platters offered:

Moo shu egg rolls,    Seared Rare Ahi Sashimi, Thai Chicken Noodle, Penne with Chicken and Peach apple cobbler just to name a few items. 

A place like this, I could get use to going whether or not there's a sporting event going on.  

I read there is at least one in Denver Colorado area if not two. I will definitely check it out.

Our server was very friendly and it was very relaxing to sit out on the patio for lunch.  We will definitely come back to the yard house, whether it's here or in Denver to see further what Yard House has to offer",review,fidu_4aHqkL_QHC1guZAWw,0,0,0,8

I was in Tempe. I was having coffee. I was sedate. I wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss Kafka or something boring. And so I called up the town's most famous resident to see what was goin' down.

""Um, YOU need to see sketchy Tempe. It is time. And I will be the one who will show it to you. Meet me at Time Out Lounge. No, wait. Meet me at Monkey Pants. Yes, Monkey Pants!""

And so I did. 

Monkey Pants! Sorry folks, but this name is nonsensically awesome. I walked in and sat myself at the round bar, joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves, each staring into nowhere in particular. Well drinks for $2.50, served in a standard kitchen glass. Nice! I proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my Tempe tour guide.

We were approached by the bartender to do discounted Patron shots....but only if we wore sombreros. There was barely anyone here on a Sunday night, and I'm of the kind who doesn't care anyway, and the thought of me and Bonnie G sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time, but shots were not on my agenda for the night. Alas.

I then got a royal tour of the place, including the great leg lamp (actually it's two legs, not just one!), shuffleboard, pool tables, couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen TV, ample board games and another section with tables and chairs, which is where we sat, under the painting of the teddy bear in Richard Simmons gear. 

Other patrons were seated all over the large space, so everyone had their own private area in a way. I actually really dug this. I'm not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like ""it's happening."" Sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway. So I may sound decrepit, but I'm really not that old. I swear.

Sure, Monkey Pants has frat-party gimmicks throughout the day, but this place has no pretense whatsoever. How can you even take it seriously? Even it doesn't take itself seriously. 

I mean, it's just sitting there. In a strip mall. In Tempe. With a painting of a teddy bear wearing Richard Simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine. Waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now.

And enjoy the now we did. 

All thanks to my Sketchy Tempe tour guide.

4 stars.

The pizza from here isn't gross like other pizza places/chains
it tastes authentic and freshly made
When we order pizza, we only order from here
We also get the wings usually we ask for extra sauce because if you don't they don't put much on them 
Other than that, its great
It take anywhere from 20-30 minutes for delivery for us",review,cqPcKMkgfWc5lu3ltuLdFg,0,1,0,8
