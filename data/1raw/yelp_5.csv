Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",review,sqYN3lNgvPbPCTRsMFu27g,4,3,1,5

The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!

The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!

lVHtVCyFJOqAH0ltn7pLuw,2009-02-04,W3R-lEDWBooITQOgwwblKw,3,"I had been craving sushi steadily for about two weeks, so I decided to try somewhere new. This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. 

I had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.

My girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. 

The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. 

I would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.",review,K46kUag6aS0Vd4JjiaqNsQ,0,0,0,5

I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.

Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.

My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. 

We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything.

The pool area is where it's at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better.

The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  

Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  

I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.

Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).

The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.

However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.

Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? 

Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.

[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.'

There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. 

     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.

     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. 

     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  
Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!",review,QiR2X306Yzd9fuJdKDhkGg,3,2,2,5

If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  

Pros - 
1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.
2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.
3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.
4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!
5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. 
6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  
7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.  
8. I love Laser for Less, CHANDLER!!!

Cons - never having to shave again, darn.",review,mqueHx5CFC9IsZxLQb3H9g,0,3,0,5

Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.

The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. 

Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.",review,hTKFGpi3ltCV4B-XDFRT-A,0,1,2,5

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn....

The baklava isn't fabulous, but everything else is worthy of a special trip.  Once again, the chicken shawarma draws me in, though I'll occasionally force myself into breaking out of that far too predictable mold (for falafel since I truly am stuck in a rut).  The hummus is great.  As mentioned, the salads mainly consist of iceburg lettuce, but they are not stingy with the feta and the dressing is amazing.

There is night, semi-scrubby outdoor seating and the drinks are bottled or canned.  Last year I went with a group of friends for Valentine's Day and there was a musician who was slightly too loud for the environment.  When something special is going on, the owner comes around and checks with the patrons to verify quality and whether or not the activity is enjoyable.  This is always a nice classy touch for a little dive.

It's a rarer occasion that I find my way down there.  Let's be honest: I only go that direction for SMoCA, the Venue of Scottsdale, and EZ Tattoo.  It's not generally ""my scene"" and it's definitely out of my way.

If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.

So I went where my friend goes and I was pleasantly surprised. Not to be snobby but I have done the strip mall walk in nail salon and usually walk out disappointed. I was expecting the absolute worst to be honest. 

The girl who worked on me NAILED IT! Pun totally intended.

I got the gel because that is all they offer. I normally get Shellac but hey...I am a convert for now. I will let you know how the hold up over time. For now my nails are amazing. Not only do they look great but it was done in half the normal time. 

The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5. 

The place is a little on the not so new or super clean side. It's not dirty it's just not 5 stars. They also do not provide you with the nail oil my regular nail lady gives me to keep my nails hydrated. The only other thing is the lack of color selection for gels. If you are feeling like you need that electric blue, neon yellow or emerald green (color of 2013) then you are out of luck.

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.",review,YnuPa08WRFw_VYQsb3rcoA,0,2,0,5

Also, free wifi!

I rarely get lost in here and to be honest, security here has never been an issue... lines have been long going to gates in Term 4 but they move fairly quickly.

I don't do body-scans (my personal choice), so if you choose to do the same, when you put your crap in the conveyor belt and you note they are only doing body scanners, alert the TSA person and let them know you'll need a pat-down (or a groping.. feel-up.... whatever you wanna call it ;)).  Electing to do this takes me longer to get through security, but I prefer it and plan ahead.

Also, if you have a digital boarding pass on your iPhone or Android and go through a *different* gate (they are mostly all connected via runways, etc) due to the line at the gate you're supposed to go through, note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass... this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line.. luckily they had the kiosk just there so I ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot.

1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!

Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...

Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.

#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar

Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.


# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal

Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.

Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.


# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami

Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.

Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  


Coconut Ice Cream: Yum

Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.

Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.

I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.

The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still.

My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.

Why do I always forget this place,
When deciding on where to eat lunch,
Here I could really stuff my face,
It doesn't matter if it's dinner or brunch.

My wonderful, tasty Honey Do,
Alfalfa sprouts, turkey on whole wheat,
Add a slice of cheddar for you,
This sandwhich cannot be beat. 

Located not to far from the hospital, 
So you get a great crowd of nurses,
The hotties who come here are pivotal,
I'll stay until the crowd disperses. 

Get the soup in a bread bowl,
Or a bag of chips if you please,
Add a cookie for your hole,
I'll say bless you after you sneeze. 

Bottom line is you cannot go wrong,
You'll love whatever you order,
Go home and hit the bong,
And then make a run for the border.

pgz6IeaZgLuzqrk6HMPhzA,2010-02-28,F21FB1A_XHfpvSdZPRo2Ng,5,"The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.

What's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.

One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.  

The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.  

What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.  

If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.",review,mQ6LzbfhBbLA5HUTKDVYfg,1,1,0,5

I recommend the sweet and spicy dog, the sunset dog, and the spam sliders Maui style. Whatever I get I usually make it a meal with tots and either red cream soda or green tea.

On my visit today they were giving away free samples of chicken wings with every meal. I liked the crispness of the skin, and once again the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. If (when) I order them in the future I'm going to ask for extra sauce though. The only thing I've had here that I wouldn't get again is a burger with chili on it. The thin chili is fine on a dog you're going to eat with a fork, not as much in a burger.

The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.

The Thai Peanut Sauce Pizza was a little weird, yet still tasty in its own way, and I could only handle one slice before growing tired of peanut sauce.  The Buffalo Chicken Wing Pizza was also pretty good. The highlight of the menu was the beer. The Elsie's Irish Cream, a milk stout, was one of the best stouts I've had (better than the Left Hand Stout). It had a strong coffee flavor but in a good way (I don't drink coffee). The Orange Blossom (mandarin orange hefeweizen) was the best Hefeweizen I've ever had, and I generally don't like Hefeweizens. The orange flavor definitely made that drink more than tolerable. I tried several other beers from Papago's own brewery, and the rest seemed  good. They have dozens of bottled beers in the fridges along the walls. But I never got a chance to try any of them. 

PRICE: Around $5 per beer on tap. Personal pizzas were $9 and large pizzas that could feed 2-3 people were $18. Appetizers were around $5. 

ATMOSPHERE: Pretty neat place. Funny statues, tvs, darts and all wooden furniture. Drawbacks are very small tables, uncomfortable chairs, odd layout, and almost too loud at times. 

SERVICE: The place seemed a little understaffed at times. We would be helped my a couple employees throughout the night as one would have to run behind the bar to make drinks or clean. All the servers were very nice and patient, but seemed to be a little overwhelmed and, thus, forgot to bring me a drink I ordered. 

SKINNY: Papago Brewing Company Inc has its pros and cons, but overall its a good place. I would definitely go there for the beer, while the pizza is good but nothing to rant about. Some may disagree with me, but I still prefer Tempe's own Four Peaks. I feel Four Peaks' food is better, better seating, and the beers are just as good as Papago's flavors.

Here is why I can't give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think he's wonderful...)

1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friend's boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited).

2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses.

3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that you'll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, I'll ask for it...just like any other retailer.  

Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctor's cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.

They were quick but thorough with the estimate, and when I brought my car back for the repair, they found some additional hidden damage, contacted the insurance company, secured a promise from them to pay the shop directly (so I didn't have to pay then wait for the insurance company to reimburse me), and still had everything done as promised, when promised, and they called me a few times to update me on the progress.

The only thing that I would like to see would be some courtesy transportation, even if it would only be offered within a certain radius.

All in all, they made the process as painless as possible.  Strong 9 out of 10; if they offered to drop me off and pick me up at work at no additional charge, it'd be a 10 out of 10.

I hope I don't need a body shop in the future, but if I do, I wouldn't hesitate to bring my car back to Brighton Collision Centers.",review,fM4dMVGeraQ-t9SDcP0bbQ,2,2,2,5

Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. 

I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. 

Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. 

Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. 

It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. 

This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"". 

Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't. 

Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy.

IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars.

I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.

I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though.

This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix, this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area.  It's that good.  Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here.  Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was.

We had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared 2 appetizers and 4 entrees.  We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.  Everything else was great.

Our entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms.  Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.

One enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai.  We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes.

The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.

So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.  

The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.  

I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.

After having a few beers, we were pretty hungry and decited to go here. This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop. Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside. Customer service was excellent. The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.",review,6-cOlCHG9gTu1iwLVm0C8w,1,1,3,5

QnAzW6KMSciUcuJ20oI3Bw,2009-10-19,4jzZIXcXOub2k1cvrlFemQ,3,"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.",review,fev0iI-XDrteD4SYRKjiUw,1,3,2,5

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  

Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.",review,m2uaBX3VmZZSc3NyD1qyoQ,1,1,0,5

There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint.

This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. 

Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).

Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. 

The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream.

While it was very nice when it first opened it's now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!

Our server, besides being very attentive and friendly, was also extremely knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients. It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which weren't let down.

The quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle ""medium"" is what I ordered and received). Simply great.

The milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though.

The fries were a little ""meh"" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as ""top notch"" good as the burgers.

The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.

First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue. 

Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.

So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this.

Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.

First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.

Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.

Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff ""who wrote such and such?"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  ""who wrote such and such"". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.

The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.",review,X6GycoLMzQaocXBANVnB4Q,0,0,0,5

For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but. 

The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. 

Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. 

I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me.

My boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two Phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college. He has weird accelerometer-type machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the Big Bang Theory proud. Kudos to the Arizona Science Center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us.

We started on the 4th floor at the Solarville exhibit which focused on energy, the environment, and conservation. It talked about individual household energy usage, and ways to reduce environmental impact. The 3rd floor had the Forces of Nature and Technology exhibits, which both offered interactive and informative displays. The 2nd floor was all about electricity, so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge. The coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the ""All About Me"" exhibit. It covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects. The neuroscience portion was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests.

Admission was $14, not including special exhibits or films. We had a limited amount of time and didn't get to check out any of the extras (IMAX film, planetarium, pirate exhibit).

I orered the following:  Sashimi Plate (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail collar), and Uni (sea urchin).

POSITIVES:
--  Price was very reasonable.  Total cost was $40 including tip.
--  The food was fresh and the portion sizes were great.  Even the Uni was extremely fresh and the amount was more than reasonable.
--  The Sashimi Plate came with soup and salad.  The dressing on the salad was excellent.

NEGATIVES:
--  The green tea was lukewarm and the waiter/waitress did not do a good job of ensuring my tea cup was always full.
--  It takes a very long time for the food to come out.  There were only 3 or 4 tables besides me so it wasn't a busy night.  
--  This is an odd one but I actually wished the Hamachi Kama didn't have so much meat on it.  Due to the large/thick amount of flesh, it didn't not have the crisp chargrilled taste to it.  Probably another reason why it took so long for it to be prepared.

I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX.

Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.

The people who work there, however, deserve one.  

On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.

We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.  

We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.

I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?

I usually order the cobb salad. From a typical deli, I'd normally expect iceberg lettuce, a handful of shaved carrots, some egg, and a little bit of bacon. But if that were the case, I wouldn't be ordering the salad again and again. The field greens and romaine lettuce are served with avocado (I'm pretty sure they use at least 1/2 an avocado for each salad), artichoke hearts, tomatoes, bacon (no bacon bits here!), radishes, blue cheese, egg, cucumbers  and I'm sure i'm forgetting something else, but it is GOOD. Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically. It's unbelievable.) I'd also recommend the Arizona caviar (black bean salad) or southwest coleslaw.

My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches (with choice of homemade barbecue sauce - each one better than the last), my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes (better than grandma's), and grandpa loves whatever is on special. Even my picky-eater brother loves food at Open Range - and that's saying something!

Bethany and Tom are the owners; Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that he's in charge of most of the barbecuein'. (He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA, they were GOOD.) The restaurant (as the name suggests) has a full service deli too, in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal.

ZYnvMVHDGqYJtX_Ikiq4hA,2011-12-08,oboTO9C19L7ZG_Z5fByiBg,2,"When I bought my house, my realtor recommended these guys for the termite inspection.  They found a couple shelter tubes (old & inactive), so I paid them to treat the house and bought a 2 year ""warranty"".  Included in the ""warranty"" is a free annual inspection and any follow-up treatments necessary.  Sounded good.

First, the good part: the treatment appears to have worked just fine as I have not seen any new evidence of creepy crawlies munching mi casa.  That's good for three stars, I suppose.  

But here's where I have a gripe.  Last fall (1 yr in to the new house), it occurred to me in passing that I'd been here a year and that I should be expecting some sort of contact from the termite people to schedule the annual inspection.  A call.  A letter.  Something saying 'Hey, you're due.'  

(I don't think this is unreasonable to expect from a service-oriented company.  Shoot, it's been well over a decade since I bought my car, and the original dealership still sends me letters saying 'Hey, you're due for your 150k service!')

I hear... nothing.  And pretty much forget about it.  Until...

Another year goes by.  I receive a letter from them, ""Hey! Your warranty is up for renewal!"" I don't recall if the first letter contains (paraphrased) ""By the way, we'd love to schedule your free annual inspection!"" or if that came in the 2nd letter... or the 1st or 2nd call.  Or maybe it was the 3rd letter and the 3rd call... 

It certainly was in the 'Hey, your warranty lapsed but if you respond right away we'll re-instate it for you AND schedule your free annual inspection' letter, though.

Which, frankly, irritates me.  A lot.  

I will not be renewing my ""warranty"" with this company as my experience has shown that I'd be paying for nothing.  

Summary: 

Treatment? Fine. It was effective.  I have no more signs of bugs.  
Service? Awful.  They'll ignore you unless they want money from you.
""Warranty""? I'm not saying it's a scam, but... um.... I certainly did not receive ANY value for the money I paid them.",review,WhLEj4nXKeX3UBkj35WJwA,0,1,0,5

First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.

Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. 

The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the ""big night out"" prix fix menu and chose the ""Fusion"" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. 
It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place.",review,5sTIqfZr45ZGEjanTXGZCg,0,1,0,5

 On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). 

After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).

I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced. 

I have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful.

It's a small place, but that's part of the appeal. There's a small upstairs patio, with a fireplace (wasn't on when I went) that could be a great spot to hang. It's not much of a view, but there's something cool about being at a higher elevation. 

Finding J. Chew was a little bit of a challenge. We ended up stopping at AZ88 to ask for directions. LOL! When we arrived, my friend and I sashayed up to the bar. Immediately we had a drink menu in front of us. I was more intrigued by the huge crystal ball-esque 20 Questions game. I wanted to play!

When I asked about beer, the 'tender motioned to the shelf above his head. Ahh... Not a great selection, but it'll do. I went with the Honey Brown. $4.50. Great price. Okay beer. I'll order something else next time, if I can make up my mind. Stella? Fat Tire? Hmm... 

The whole reason for venturing to J. Chew was for a celebration. My friend was getting married, and this was her final Saturday night as a ""single."" So, the group of women sat outside on the small patio area. It was a cold, chilly May evening and they had the fireplace going. They also had a couple heat lamps working, but most of them were out of propane. Bummer. We Phoenix Dwellers were shivering our coconuts off, if you know what I mean. (Praise Allah for fingerless gloves, which were a big hit that night.) But, the bartender did try and keep them going, so we appreciated his efforts!

Overall, I like J Chew. Yet I can't rate it higher than 3.5 for a few reasons. Yes, one is the beer selection. While it's small, it's also doable. Yet, their mixed martini list looked disgusting. Then again, I don't do martinis. Nor do I throw down $11 on a mixed drink. 

But the real annoyance came from other patrons. From one guy in a hockey jersey throwing himself against the glass door (even hitting his head on the glass, when prompted) to a crazy D'Backs fan yelling in the face of a calm Braves supporter, those couple of guys just totally zapped the cool, calm and collected from J. Chew & Co. There's something defeating and sad about seeing another man yell ""Lock it up!"" at another man, during what could be a calm, mature discussion about two sports teams they individually love and follow. There's something even sadder about watching an aging man with a cigar hit on a married woman. He just wouldn't leave our group alone. Oh well...Maybe they won't be there when I go back... because I think if they are, I'm gonna have to say something. How obnoxious. 

If you're in Old Town and looking for a chill spot to hang, this is your place. Plus, I liked the music they had on rotation... From Modest Mouse and Postal Service to 90's grunge and alternative rock, I was diggin' the tunes, along with the laid back atmosphere, the great service and the knowledge that there was a chill place in Snottsdale to hang. Who knew?! I just don't think there's a strong enough draw to hang at this place all night. This is more of your ""before dinner"" or ""before another bar"" type of estabilshment.

Service was quick and friendly.  We got in right before a rush and let me tell you, the staff were able to handle it like pros.

Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one.  You can tell how proud they are of their creations.  I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose, you will love.

jsvIv9NRRBXdmCe8b88b4A,2011-12-30,p8f5SRmv17OZeQiXowTzmA,5,"We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.  I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.   There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different. The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesn't have the same feel as the Saguaro course.  The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes. That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play.

Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.  Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.  This has led to some interesting memories.  

The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.  He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.  It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes. Not a chance.

Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed. He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert. Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!  Of course, we haven't let him forget the five provisionals...

I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree. However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.  The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.  She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective.

The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens. Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them).

Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees.

I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it.",review,w_hcSjqLeSZQL9Rx1UP-Tw,0,0,0,5

I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.

First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.

Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.

We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled. 

I was overall not impressed by anything except a patron's sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache. I can see the charm there and I probably will give it another shot but based on this trip 2 stars is fairer than fair.",review,6WrOT1dj6sigl_voiwQ7HA,1,3,2,5

UxvOXcoCRFRAVhRB0D9imw,2008-02-25,Mtgnj4dH9RE_zLGSTHyY2A,5,"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!

A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.  The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.  Delicious nonetheless.  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.) and it added to the soup quite nicely.  Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?  There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!  The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were ""Hungry Man"" sized.

Some side notes:

1.  Parking is awful for lunch.  If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.

2.  I ordered a water with lemon.  I received a water with no lemon.  When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.  I couldn't come up with one.  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.  Period.

3.  We walked in and staff #1 seated us.  Staff #2 took our order.  Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.  Staff #4 brought our meal.  Staff #5 cleared our plates.  Staff #6 brought our check.  Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?  I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of ""who will show up next and what is their task?""  It was still a little ridiculous.

4.  Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.  No shortage there.  It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  A big up for Taylor's.

5.  For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.

I will definitely be back again.  Enjoy!",review,-Dof9NwAoQwRM-GVPZk5zw,3,5,2,5

Yet.

Let me explain.

1) Rose & Crown - The Hours. If it is really meant to be a British pub and a new asset to downtown nightlife, it needs to strongly declare A) YES! WE ARE OPEN! and B) YES! WE ARE OPEN *LATE*! When you're turned away when you excitedly show up at midnight on a Saturday because they decided to close for whatever reason, you're not going to be too excited about trying to go back the next time. What's a British pub doing closing so early? I went out of my way to go here, to experience this new bar and enjoy its offerings, and was sent packing. Meh. So I was surprised when a bunch of Yelpers decided to make it a meetup spot a few weeks later. Well, maybe this time, at 10:30, we'd be more fortunate with it staying open. 

And we were. Rock on.

2) Rose & Crown - The Setting. I gather that the business owners are extremely limited with how much they can change with the house since it's probably a landmark with stringent regulations on how much of the interior can be changed, but since I've eaten at Circa 1900 a number of times before it vacated the premises, walking in here felt exactly the same. Sitting at the EXACT same 4-top table I ate before. The room hadn't changed one iota when it came to layout or furniture. Even the angles the tables were placed at. That was a little odd. The only main changes in the front west room were the giant visages of the Queen and good ol' Winston glaring down at you. In any case, it was kind of hard for me to make the mental transition from ""this is a sit-down restaurant"" to a ""this is going to be your local English pub"" when it comes to the indoors. Was it nice? Definitely. It's really nice inside. But pubby? No. That said, the front balcony is a really great location to hang out on, and I can imagine how great it'll be around springtime. But the balcony's more an asset of the great old house itself. 

3) Rose & Crown - The offerings. Standard selection of beers, including good ol' English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap. Food menu not too big, but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing, so I ordered those. I was skeptical, but to my surprise, the fish was great, as was their spin on the tartar sauce. Fries were also tasty, but fries are fries, and I'm going to devour them anyway because I was crazy hungry. But all in all, thumbs up on the food.

4) Rose & Crown - The service. Was kind of there but more present at the beginning and then invisible near the end when were ready to leave, thus having to go back inside, tell the bar manager what we ordered since he didn't have the bill, and then pay him instead of our server. Kind of odd.

So all in all, as I said already, 3.67 stars. I'm definitely willing to go back there and be open to editing my review and increasing its star wattage, but for now, it hasn't completely won me over. Definitely has a lot of promise, with its abundance of Britpop playing and proximity to Bianco, the sporting venues, ASU, etc., but they need to work on being consistently open late before I think about making this one of my definite go-to institutions.",review,htC49ZwXiKNka5cp0GKBfQ,3,5,3,5

This Mamma Mia is now the closer of the two to my house, and at first I was a little worried. I wasn't sure if both locations were going to be good, but I'm not worried anymore.

Whenever I go there, I get slices. I also usually only spend about $6. To me, that's awesome when I'm craving some pizza pie. By the way, Mamma Mia serves good ol' fashoined NY-style pizza. Their toppings range from traditional (roni, sausage, veggies) to fancy (salmon, bleu cheese, capers). I have been known to order capers on my slices (and they were actually really good). Normally I ask for the slices well done, and I'd recommend you do the same if you like that extra bit of crispiness like me. The slices come out relatively quickly, and I've never been dissatisfied with what I've been given.

I've yet to try their sandwiches or pastas, but in time I'm sure I'll get around to it. At $6 or less a pop, I feel like I've got a good thing going.

zOCdVUKUN3b-obT67Qjyww,2011-09-12,WpwIA0YmpDEqAoH_hjSG2A,3,"Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to. 

I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. 

We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a ""sampler"", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. 

The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. 

For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! 

No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. 

I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). 

The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. 

Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.

I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. 

To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: ""That big ass pretzel made me thirsty""!  

Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.

Would I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at.",review,3qMUN6NGDq1GWtAJSuvXIQ,1,1,2,5

Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!

Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!

Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)

In fact, I looked into attending Ai of Phoenix for a graphic design degree and decided it was not the path I needed (or wanted). The decision came, though, after a couple months of trying to sort things out with them. I applied. I met with a career counselor. I had to submit some more paperwork. I went on a tour. I then was sent to meet a financial adviser, who had to be barely 18. That's when I realized that the majority of these students were young, inexperienced and knew to college life. I, on the other hand, already had a degree. I was looking to combine my past experience with a design degree to enhance my career. 

I also realized Ai isn't willing to working with professional students. They don't take into consideration your work schedule as much as they should, especially if they want to appear accommodating and understanding to students who are truly committed to going to Ai. Case in point: In order to get the ""a-ok"" to take only 9 credit hours a semester, I would have had to get the permission of the Graphic Design Faculty Advisor - or something. Ai really pushes a full-time schedule on its students, even if they offer evening classes. Silly. 

Plus, I didn't like being treated like an idiot. I mean, do I have to tell you over and over again that I already have a degree, that I know what to expect from paperwork and financial aid? Can you not see I'm annoyed at some 18 year-old who can't operate a computer to tell me what my cost would be per semester? Can you not tell I'm irked when I make known I'm on my lunch break, and I'm told it'll be another hour before we're finished? I don't like somebody wasting my time. True, I can be impatient. But this was ridiculous.

That's when I decided this place wasn't for me. Sure, I've heard great things about it, but the people who have gone here have told me I could have gotten a comparable degree and built a better portfolio somewhere else.

We went on a Saturday around noon and it was packed!  There were several larger tables open but nothing to accomodate 2 people so being the outgoing person I am, I invited a couple people to join us so we could take a larger table.

What a great way to meet people, and they were great tablemates!

The food is good, I only have a couple CONS....

No low sodium soy sauce and most of the food is VERY salty!

The selection is not great, no calamari or bbq pork and several other items I enjoy.

The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet,,, their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse. (bummer) and the owner just doesnt seem to care.

After looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldn't wait to check it out.
Unfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didn't get to try any of those tempting dishes.

The restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. There's a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place.

But...after tasting the food...meh.

The buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didn't like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it.
As for the vegetarians, well, we didn't have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else.
The dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland.

So, overall, I wasn't impressed. But I don't want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so I'm thinking maybe it's got something better to offer me..

They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back.

Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial.

But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot.

I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava. 

If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it?

The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless.

In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served.",review,GRgBu4K7GOb3354esp_xkg,1,4,3,5

My one visit was fine, but didn't leave me wanting more.  However, when Deb L hosted a recent UYE, it was the perfect opportunity for great company at the very least.  Well I'm happy to report I received even more than great company....great food, great service, and comfortable, yet beautiful surroundings were also on the plate.  

I began the evening with a glass of their house-made sangria.  I could drink this light and fruity beverage all day.  In fact, I think it would make a fine substitute for my morning OJ.  I did have a hard time choosing an entree.  While I was tempted by the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, I chose the goat-cheese chicken instead.  The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!!

The Herb Box also graciously offered our table a variety of sweet treats at the end of the meal...a slice of fig bundt cake (my favorite), a couple different cupcakes, a whoopie pie, and a passionfruit cake.  While all were enjoyed, none of these wowed me.  I do think these may have been pastries available at the market, and not their dessert menu items.   

So thanks to Deb for giving me a reason to try The Herb Box.  I'm sure I will be back again!  I didn't get a chance to browse the market!",review,wHg1YkCzdZq9WBJOTRgxHQ,5,5,4,5

I finally had my first ever Valley Oregano's experience tonight. You'd think I'd have gone to the one on Camelback ages ago, because, well, I live minutes away from it, but no, it was the Tempe location which sucked me in. 

Ok, not necessarily sucked me in. I drove my ass all the way out there to meet some friends for dinner, but still. 

Wait was an hour which kind of bit. We were tempted to just go to Thai Basil instead but as I never had Oregano's we persisted and stayed put. Once seated, we ordered things that I won't be eating anything close to resembling for the rest of the week: the spinach salad (ok, maybe I'd eat that), the cheesy bread, a large thin crust pesto pizza, and the pizokie for dessert. I'm a huge deep dish fan (I know, I know, thin crust is how real Italian pizza is) so I'm going to reserve major potential star wattage for when I actually have one of those. 

I thought the pesto thin crust was pretty decent - didn't blow me out of the water but it was good. The salad was flavorful and the cheesy bread was decent, but the pizokie dessert thing was awesome. Maybe it's because I I haven't had one of these since BJ's back in college (which is a longtime ago), but it was pretty damn delicious. Scene was pretty much college-y, loud, and full of ""like, I was all""s, but duh, what else is it going to be.

chicken fingers - Decent, although I've been spoiled by Shane's BBQ tenders which are made in house. I'm assuming Culver's came frozen in a big bag and then were deep fried. Still, pretty good for fast food.

Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.
Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.

Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!
The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.
I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.

We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.

I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a ""Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter"" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up! 

Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. 

Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone.

When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.  Sad that it wasn't a better first impression.",review,IajbWwj6l-KHrfSEwZBLgw,1,1,1,5

The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.

Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious. 

The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to ""groin-grabbingly delicious."" (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods. 

The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.

I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.

The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.

The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.

I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.

Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?

A family friend once told me that the way to tell a good restaurant is how busy it is.  Seems like common sense now, but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than 10 people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed?

Well Sticklers was packed.  My first impression was ""Crap, the line is 20 people deep and we only have 40 minutes for lunch...there's no way""!  Well I was pleasantly surprised when we got through the entire line, food in hand, in about 5!  The guys and gals that work there are efficient and have it down.  And they showed some great patience for a newbie.

The chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick.  Word of warning to the lactose intolerant - it's a 2-piller!

Taneko starts off wanting to be a Japanese-style pub restaurant, but ends up throwing way too much Scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant.

The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce.  My kid likes the fried rice, though it is a little too much on the ginger side.  There's a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  It's way too expensive for what little meat you get, but it's an awful lot of fun.

The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just don't care for all of the introductions - I'm not going to remember the names of the 4 or 5 people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think that's the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing.

Overall, I've enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiro's and even Sakana, I'm probably not going back real soon.",review,kOyW4HTOFNX1NqIA-eyKyA,1,2,1,5

I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time. 

So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to ""walk-in"" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place. 

I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really? 

The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake. 

When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart.

The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.

My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.

We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in it's own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldn't help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin'.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.

The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I don't remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasn't ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I don't do dill pickles.

Flash forward to the next pickup day, the stain was still there. I asked for a manager, and it happened to be someone that seemed to be the owner. He asked how much I paid for the shirt. 

They gave me a check for the FULL amount. 

It's very rare that I write a review update that spans a few stars (only DeFalco's comes to mind), but Seville took my crappy situation, and made it right.

I had the Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza, and it was great. The crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie. The center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chip-like ""crunch"". The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza.

M had the Turkey salad, and she too was very pleased. I can describe hers much - as we both stuck to our plates!

The waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well; however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star.",review,yGs16xQiN3dLo03OQyto8A,1,1,1,5

Now for the bad: The food is overpriced for it's quality. The steaks look fatty, the salads wilted, and flavor pretty bland. It would probably be okay if we weren't looking at 20 plus dollars per entree. Back in the day, Durant's was very high end and elite, so I could see the pricing from that perspective. However, if they want to stay in the game, they need to keep the food up to par as well. 
5 stars plus for ambiance, relaxation, a throw back feel, and great drinks! 1 star for food and food prices. 
However, a major landmark in Phoenix, so please check it out! We never know how long these staples will be around. I would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer.

6ie9xvy2WW1pn7RuBvGNhg,2009-05-07,yx6ZbicEb2Pqbbb0OUF5Sg,5,"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.

An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.

For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.

For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.

For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.

So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is.

It's definitely a wonderful first impression of Phoenix -- from the cross-section of society to the people-watching, and last but not least, the AMAZING breathtaking views, of wildlife (like roadrunners, chipmunks, and lizards), flora and the Valley below.

It's been noted as one of the most hiked trail in in the nation.",review,4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA,2,2,2,5

I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.  

We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.

My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.

I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.

We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious.

The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.

A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon. We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making! 

My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways!

For one we did not have to get all that dirty. Not dirty at all really. Also not that I mind dirty. This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go.

And two - we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena.

Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey. The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate (or item of the bride to be's choice) which we will then give to her as a wedding present. I thought this idea was really original.

So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked. All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works.

Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation. The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way. We finished about 4 hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity.

Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted. I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs - but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon :)

I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples, (it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down).  I appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in just-right amounts (as in, not so much that some of it will end up going bad).

Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk.

A trip to the Aji Spa (located at the Sheraton Wildhorse Pass Resort and Spa) was at the top of my list during my recent trip to Arizona on Memorial Day Weekend. We made our reservations well in advance. Having gone to a few spa resorts, I couldn't wait to pay this one a visit. 

My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package, which was comprised of 2 services each. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa. After changing in the women's locker room, and relaxing in the private women's lounge area (there's a large lounge area, but it's co-ed), our masseuses met us and brought us into our room. My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage. After only having solo massages, I was interested how a companion massage differed. The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by. My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable, relaxing and beneficial. 

After our massages were completed, we had some time in between our next service, feeling a little hungry, we decided to grab some lunch from the spa's cafe. I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR! Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli, grilled chicken pieces, pesto sauce, marinated bell peppers, melted cheese and avocado. My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory, a little fuzzy, but that was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!! 

After lunch sometime, we each were up for our second service, our facials!!! Due to my skin type, I received the Aji Rain Facial. My esthetician was wonderful! Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure. I left that room with my face feeling renewed, clean and fresh!

All spa treatments include full use of the spa's facilities so we definitely made well use of that! After our facials, we used the sauna (the steam room was out of service during our visit) and whirlpools located on the women's locker side. We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool. The Aji Spa is such a calm, warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap! Outside! In desert heat! Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade! The staff at the spa provided excellent service! From the front desk, to our masseuse, the esthetician, the cafe staff and the locker room attendant! While napping, one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it!

Our appointment started at 12pm and with our 2 procedures, and lunch, we should have been done and out of there within a few hours. But the point of visiting the spa was to relax, and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place, we just didn't want to leave!  We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival, and we would have stayed longer if we could! 

I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area, or if you're looking for a new spa to travel to! Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service. They even emailed me the same day of my service as a ""Thank You"" for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit! A 5-star spa, indeed!",review,yHCzZTF641SyRQGoefRvQA,2,7,0,5

I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.

It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.

Positives
I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.

Negatives
Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great.",review,GkWuTgewni9bzPM4HUCO-g,2,3,0,5

I have had Khmer food before, which is ironic, as my wife is from Vietnam, but never had Khmer food from Cambodia.  She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap.

Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.  

The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).  

The Katheaw Cha is also very good.  

I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!)

My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.  

I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.

Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good. 

The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming. 

At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals. 

I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time i'll try the chicken.",review,N7lSh49zQ13sG3Jpa9E6cw,3,3,2,5
