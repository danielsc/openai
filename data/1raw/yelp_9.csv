7SO_rX1F6rQEl-5s3wZxgQ,2011-10-03,GxaYFCprt-wyqO--vB4PHQ,4,"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, ""how nice"", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.

So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a ""different"" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",review,J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ,1,2,1,9

Y-NqaDy_1bb-Y5dQ33x-Pw,2010-07-22,15YFoHK5HPQpg1u_vwbqmA,4,"Sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop. They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed.

What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.

When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). 

It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!

The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.

Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.",review,80PHOfM8KOBb7xEQN4C0lg,0,0,0,9

Famous Dave's is fine.  There are two of them I know of, and I've been to both.  They're both fine.

We visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK.

The brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didn't have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasn't severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor.

And a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their 'for sale' bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, it's just ""not right"".  That's not how BBQ is done.

Anyway, Famous Dave's is really nothing special.  The BBQ is ""OK"", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joe's, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joe's, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Tom's BBQ, that's for sure (see my review of Tom's...truly awful).

Firstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). 

It was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.

After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My ""corner"", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.
Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. 
After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.
After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.
I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.
I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!
I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.",review,T2YhY--VPurB8rPJ-Q5giw,2,3,2,9

Ok....I just had the most amazing facial there today....I never experienced anything like it.  And my pedicure rocked also.

I don't think I picked a better day to have a little relaxation.  I rode almost 24 miles today (I swear it was all uphill) and I had the worst pain in my legs.  (Yes, I did stretch)  

My pedicure was great...Shannon does a wonderful job....though now I have straight line syndrome with french man/pedicures.  Since I hate it that they have to use latex gloves, I couldn't tell at all that she was wearing them when i was getting my massage.  AND!  She actually made my feet completely soft and dry skin free.  That alone is a miracle.

Andiamo....

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...",review,htC49ZwXiKNka5cp0GKBfQ,17,16,13,9

The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .

Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the ""red"" or ""white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.

Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. 
I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings. 

Parking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety. 

The entertainment was very limited. I hope they will seek more entertainment in the future especially since they claim its one of the top 20 street festivals in the country.

They do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing. All of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar. They use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read. It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-5 be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice.

Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. 
Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. 

Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger.

The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. 

As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. 

The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.

Here's my old review for reference: 

Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.

It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.

It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though.",review,Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg,4,3,0,9

The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth.

While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. 

After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. 

The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. 

The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones.

The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).  

Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well.

I am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those ""return for"" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one.

As for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although it's not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palate's stamp of approval. 

A huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!!

First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress. 

We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet. 

The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here.

I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me.

Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?

DINNER:

Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered ""All Day Happy Hour,"" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their ""Half and Half."" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. 

My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. 

Overall, the food is average ""bar style"" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. 

JUST DRINKS:

Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)

As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! 

Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. 

SO WHY GO? 
Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)

If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!",review,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA,3,4,0,9

The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were.

The tables were crowded, too close together, and the place was uncomfortably noisy. Our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us set down a fork (no one was waiting for our table), and asked for our dessert orders while we were still eating.

Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade ""adult"" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!

We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.

Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.

Pros: wider assortment of toppings and menu items, including the veggie sandwich (not a soy pattie - just veggies and cheese, if you want; extra menu items like jalapeños and hot sauce, grilled mushrooms, etc.; Cajun styled french fries (their small size is enormous).

Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out. 

Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers, all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In ""N Out's thinner patties.

Typically, the purpose a bar serves me is to quench a thirst brought on by numerous factors, the most typical one being the uncanny excitement I have for making poor (but fun) decisions.

I never want to come here. Ever.

Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either.

My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity. 

Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up...",review,fbxlboEmXOv6TiznpXgdyg,0,1,0,9

I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for ""decent"".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.

I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.

First of all, the waiter had no idea what the soup was or what kind of bread they had available since apparently their actual bread inventory bore no resemblance to the one printed on the menu. The waitress berated him for not knowing, and then went on to make it obvious she hadn't a clue herself. She tried to talk us into getting croissants. Neither of us were ordering things that belonged on croissants. My dining companion got a portabella burger that's a burger with a giant mushroom cap instead of meat for people sans veggie friends -and I got a chicken sandwich and Italian wedding soup. We had to repeat the order two or three times before the waiter got it.

The waiter subsequently returned my dining companion how she wanted her burger done. She gently pointed out that portabella burgers have only two possible states- done and note done. Such is the dichotomy of mushroom burger kind. ""Wait, you wanted a what?"" slurred the waiter. He had put in for a regular beef burger. Turned out, they didn't actually have a portabella in the place. 

We waited. The soup showed up in one of those skinny coffee mugs and the waiter tried to pawn it off on the wrong person. It was pretty good soup, but there was simply no way to adjust the seasonings without making a sloshy mess. 

My sandwich, well, it was OK. Nothing to write home about. I was very hungry and it didn't strike me until I was almost done the promised buttermilk ranch dressing was regular ranch with buttermilk.  My dining companion's fruit was on the old side, and her tuna melt not particularly tuna-tastic.

We are masochists. We decided to have some dessert. The one thing on the menu we wanted was, of course, not actually available, so we decided to just go with coffee. Mum ordered cold coffee. She specifically said, ""I'll have a small iced coffee."" I ordered a double shot of espresso. Not too complex. 

The waiter came back a moment to make sure I really wanted a double shot of espresso in my iced coffee.

Most of the time, I just need the end of my layers cleaned up and why would I want to spend $60 on a haircut to do that?  I have never had any problems with not getting what I wanted. Sometimes, I'll also spend the extra $20-$25 and have them shampoo and blow-dry my hair straight. My hair always looks great when I do that, too. Today, I spent $38 on the cut, shampoo and blow-dry. The blow-dry took alot longer than I wanted today, but Keeyla (sp?) also took the flat-iron to it.

Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.",review,UMq89piQvpAVFVfiGc6ndA,0,0,0,9

fK7ujDbjhRFEe2D7eIwK4w,2010-11-30,Zq97qvYd_CSchS_ixk25pA,4,"I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.

There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:

1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).

2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  

3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).

Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.",review,w4suxL1zlxsihVlugZZDAQ,2,1,0,9

My friend and I decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday.  It was very busy, which was promising.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly.  

The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL.  The ""mango"" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke).  YUCK.  The rice pudding was not worth eating either.  

The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food!  Really?  I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didn't expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon.  He said his manager was ""fussy"" and wouldn't like it.  I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasn't ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10! 

He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone.  I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter. 

I don't foresee returning there.",review,k0-S9vOCLquje8TMKmjVDQ,0,3,1,9

1. Nobuo at Teeter House.

4. Mekong Supermarket.

I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.

Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar. 

This place has it all.

I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours.

Good:
1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen.
2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area.
3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.
4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. 

Bad:
1) Bed pillows were too squishy. 
2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.
3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.

Ugly:
1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really ""ugly"".

We came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, that's for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again.

The gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didn't finish it again. I don't know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it.

This is typically a $3 theater, we happened to go on a Tuesday and it turns out they have $2 Tuesday so it was even cheaper. You definitely get what you pay for...this theater has been around for a while but it's a great deal compared to the average movie gong cost. The concessions are also reasonable cost. Not the most comfortable seats in the world but you get what you pay for.

The reason this place is a hoot? There are crazy decorations, life size figurines, games, etc, everywhere. I am sure I only really saw about a third of the decorations because it is just sensory overload. I hear they really deck it out at Christmas.

Zw5fzZhYmrLgdM0CVmGTeA,2008-03-09,3NzDi8_xfY9BxKWMbeudPg,4,"the things I liked:

the cart.
 it was much smaller than a regular shopping cart, but somehow our  baby carrier fit in it with-wise. * Update ( they got rid of the small carts.)
You can fill it up and not spend $300. This has happened to me before at Fry's, and its a bummer.
Since they are new, they are the cleanest they will ever be. I have a huge dirty cart handle issue. F&E like most grocery stores have the disinfectant wipes but that grosses me out more for some reason.
the steering on the carts was easy like ikea's carts with out the crazy hydroplane maneuver.

The food.
Everything F&E brand had very minimal marketing on the packaging which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality of food, not how nice the fake prepared image on the front looked. 
I have yet to taste it though, ill update when I do. * Update (Prepared food is kinda hit or miss)
They have only 1 or maybe 2 brands of the same exact item which makes decisions easy, either you want it or don't, no comparing labels and whatnot. which makes you end up buying less stuff.
It also makes for a shorter trip to the grocery store. No more putting off going to the market. Even though I have managed to make myself only shop the outside of the gigantic grocery stores (Produce, meat, dairy bakery) it still takes a long time to trek through the store.

Last grabs.
If you needed  they have a small pharmacy aisle grocery brand pet food, and baby care/household aisle. shampoo.... whatever.

One of these things is not like the other...
so the chip aisle has F&E brand chips and cookies and all nicely packaged and then at the end were flaming hot Cheeto's? maybe thats the part where they sell local goods. frito-lay is the best we have?

They do not take American express and watch out for the fine print on the coupons. * Update ( They now accept AMEX)

$.
Somethings cost much less than at normal markets, and some were the exact same. 
they also discount Items that are close to their expiration, so you can go ahead and grab that milk instead of pulling 3 out looking for the latest expiration. same thing with baked goods, meat products and produce.

The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.

 Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm).

I didn't realize that ALL the Embassy suites do the Manager's happy hour in the evenings; this one was 5:30 - 7:30...But let me back it up a bit. My whole experience here was wonderful.

A nice man, Terry, drove the shuttle from the airport and was very helpful giving me some ""things to do ideas"" around the area - movie theatre, shopping mall...etc. When we pulled up to the front he even pointed out a restaurant next door, 7-11 and CVS. I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention.

I went inside and checked in- very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage- hot coffee/tea/cocoa.  She even told me how to access the internet free of charge.  I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing!

I had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk.  It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer- I ended up turning it off I was so cold.  I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didn't find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet- fast and easy.  I called to see about getting a bathrobe and some toothpaste and it was brought up in less than 10 minutes!

I thought about going sightseeing and ended up taking a nap. I didn't realize how tired I was!  The bed was great! Comfy and warm!  I didn't want to get up!  But I ended up getting up so I could go to CVS across the street for a few needed items.

Next morning when I left, there was nothing I needed to do to check out and the shuttle service back to the airport was very prompt. 

I wouldn't mind staying here again should I be stopping through town or stuck overnight on an unforseen layover!

The fist time I went with my husband for dinner. It was the first place we dined after moving here from Chicago. As always we started with the oysters which were good quality and delicious. He loved his French Onion Soup as well. I had a special, the Halibut which had a lovely and inventive presentation. The only issue was the seasoning. I do not think it was seasoned at all. My husband had the same issue with the Short Ribs.  Maybe the kitchen just missed a step.  I do not like things over seasoned but this was bland.  The  Zinc Valrona Chocolate Souffle was simply amazing. I am not a chocolate lover, except for souffle. It was the perfect exclamation point to our dinner. 

I went for lunch with my mother who only eats plain burgers, plain chicken and pasta with marinara. I don't know how she manages to stay thin. We settled on Zinc. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a lovely arugula and tomato and a light sauce.  She of course had a plain burger which she raved about.

rwQIBAM_kHtVl1Ks8Flexw,2012-05-19,rgcAxnDTJpitZal3Zifc_g,2,"""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my experience here tonight.
 
I have a sneaking suspicion that this is the go-to sushi place for people who either
 A) don't know anything about good sushi or
 B) have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket

I didn't really know what to expect from this place before we arrived. I'd never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go was because it was close to my boyfriends house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in price and quality of food.
My boyfriend and I arrived before our friends and we walked to in an almost completely deserted restaurant. There was some really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of Dr. Phil on the television. I sat down in one of their ridiculously tall bar chairs while my boyfriend went to grab us a menu we could look over while waiting for our friends to arrive. 
Most. Uncomfortable. Chairs. Ever! 
I couldn't have been sitting in it longer than a couple of mins before I had to get up out of it. The seat had an aluminum bar or something all the way around it that dug into my leg after sitting down. It's hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable, but if you've been here before you know what I mean. They clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone. 
Anyway, our friends arrived and we all ordered our food. I decided on getting the ultimate salmon roll and I believe it was called the sun roll. I could be wrong on the name of that second one but it was something close to that. My boyfriend got a couple rolls and we decided to share a plate of tuna sashimi. For the 2 rolls I ordered and the plate of sashimi it was almost $40. My boyfriend got the sunshine roll and a las vegas roll. Those two rolls plus a drink was more than $20. So all together we spent more than $60. I love sushi. I would be more than happy to pay those prices for a plate of delicious fish. But what came out was not what I was expecting for the price we paid. 
My rolls were pretty, but they were almost inedible. I pretty much choked down the ultimate sushi roll. 2 or 3 pieces into eating it I debated wether or not it was worth finishing. The little tiny bit of smoked salmon that was inside was dry and I could barely taste the fresh salmon that was conservatively layered on top. I moved onto the whatever-sun roll and that was a little bit better but it was still lacking in flavor and texture. The sashimi was just awful. It didn't taste like fish, it almost didn't taste like anything, and the texture of it was really weird. It was almost chewy. My boyfriend and I have been known to just down entire plates of sashimi in less than a min or two, but after one piece he called it quits and it took me the entire rest of our time in the restaurant to finish the plate.
The staff was pretty nice, I mean they weren't going out of their way to be pleasant with us but they weren't rude either. 
All together I'd say this visit and the food was a total failure. I feel like this place's only saving grace is that it's clean and it's in a pretty convenient location. I would have liked to give this place another shot and try another couple of rolls before writing my review, but I was REALLY disappointed with the ""food"" (I am having a hard time even using that word because it was barely edible) I ordered. It wasn't the worst sushi in the world, but it wasn't anywhere near the best. And with the prices they're charging for these lack-luster rolls, I really don't see myself ever coming back here again.",review,ESrdXpT1yF7KZX52bPpnJg,0,1,0,9

I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.

The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.  

I'm so glad we did. 

We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.

After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night.. 

About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..

After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food.

My favorite pot stickers EVER.  The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time. 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable! The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.  It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?) underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.  MMMMMMmmmmm.

The green curry is more brothy than others than other's that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.  You may need a spoon :) 

The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection. Their sauces are spot on.  

BEST Coconut ice cream!  It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS!

The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience.

Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:

For one, if you don't mind spending the money the toro ""tour"" is great.  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro.  From real fatty to a little less.  Melts in your mouth.  The presentation is very impressive.  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.

All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared

The steak is excellent.  The flavor is spectacular,  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked, always and without fail, exactly to you specification.

All tempura dishes are great

Grilled zucchini.... Very good and juicy.

Seabass with miso.  Cooked perfectly.

I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter.  It makes for a very good experience.  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost.  Just go for it, tske your time and experience it all.  It will make for a very good experience.

Try their very unique drinks, they are very refreshing.

Or, if you are real daring, the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience.

I guess there is a whole slew of stuff we missed seeing, and some other exhibits we passed were closed for a wedding.  I guess it's cool to get married in the orangutan exhibit.  Or else the orangutans were getting married.  (Maybe those anti-gay marriage folks were right in that it would lead to animal marriages??!)

Anyways, we all know it's not the greatest of zoos because it's freaking hot half the year and it's not super nice to subject a lot of animals to 115 degrees.  But it's a decent enough selection, they have friendly staff, it's clean, and they have free parking. GD I love me some free parking.

Lots of the ""learn more by pressing this button"" things didn't work.  At least one water fountain didn't work (but hey- it was conveniently next to an overpriced soda machine!).  Like most other zoos they make you exit through the gift shop, so your wee ones can spend the car ride home crying about how they didn't get x overpriced toy/stuffed animal.

I do think if your kids are young enough, you could probably just take them past the ticket counter and check out the animals you can see below the bridge/in the water.

You could tell they were gearing up for it so I can tell they get pretty busy.  So come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door.  

I like that their menu isn't huge with zillions of burger combos and other options.  It was pretty straight forward.  I had the standard burger, fries and a drink.  Everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok.  The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner.

The burger was thick, juicy and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious.  The fries were also pretty good.  They are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.  I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so I used it for my fries and my burger.  I think it was some chipotle mayo stuff.  It was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers and/or fries.

Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure.

The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather. 

We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal.

After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it. :)

Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue!

Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that.

my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. 

mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.

the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. 

and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount!

District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a ""Hawaiian"" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a ""downtown restaurant"" more than the ""place in the Sheraton""...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.

The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a ""wine bar"" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.

We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.  

I'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.",review,qASPib1Z8ft8e96dtbh66w,8,12,4,9
1M4oczf2lmkdgbrJ3J7OqA,2008-08-23,Qk5lp15fIkZoWVPnY4e0eA,5,"I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.

First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. 

The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. 

The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  

The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  

Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.

Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the ""chef's chef"". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!

The first and only problem I had with the place was the fact that I wanted nearly everything on the menu. They have amazing specials, and while the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and glazed-walnut French toast looked amazing, I was hungry and opted for the Hawaiian breakfast.

The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didn't order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed one's are so expensive it's actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise.

My mom opted for the healthy option, getting the yogurt parfait. In my opinion, this was the disappointment of the table. My mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like Beijing's yogurt. My mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all I tastes was some store bought low-fat vanilla. The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5? In my opinion, a little better than that. My dad, opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros. He ate it so quickly I didn't get a taste, so I can only assume it was tasty.

Reasonable prices, and products that don't completely fall apart the first time you use them (but they are still made in China) and no service whatsoever. And Dick's is more like a Dillard's or Macy's because they have the higher end brands and employees that are older than 16 or 17 years old. So then I guess Bass and Cabela's would be more like Nordstrom's? That's where the really nice stuff is but you usually walk out without purchasing anything unless they are having a sale. Except Cabela's is sort of specialized so I think that would be more analogous to something like an Ann Taylor.

Ok, I know I have gone way off topic here but I think I have made it abundantly clear that I am not a regular customer. But I do occasionally come in to buy gifts for family and friends. On my most recent visit, I came in, wandered around for about 20 minutes and then found what I needed (with no help whatsoever from staff), paid and left. A two star experience for sure but I have to give them an extra one since they offer a discount when you check in thru the Yelp app on your smart phone and so that saved me 10 bucks.",review,VPXgY9lGJF3XC4ZpusxNuA,1,2,1,9

I just pretended to like them, but they're skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!

What?  No... you're right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!

I have had their tacos and enchiladas and prefer Arriba's (right next door) or Carlos O'briens, just down the street. There is even some mom and pop place by my apartments that equates to the quality and taste. 

What I like about Los Olivos is their Nachos. OMG this thing is huge. Imagine a large pizza in your head and then replace that image with the same size plate of nachos. I am not even kidding. Four or more people could munch on this. They do it exactly how I like it too, lots of cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole. YUM 

That is what has been keeping me coming back, but after the other night I feel I am sure to find somewhere whose nachos make me just as happy. 

Every time I have been here, it has been dead. And last time I came at prime dinner time. Then why is the service so awful? This kid kept coming up to our table and trying to take things. We weren't even half way done with our nachos when he asked while I'm in MID BITE ""are you finished with that"" not only asking but reaching his hand to grab the plate! And this happened repeatedly as we tried to finish our food. I don't know if they wanted us out of there or what. And then for someone who was so ""attentive"" I waited for 5-10 minutes for a drink refill (make the glasses clear and it won't be so hard to tell if I need more) 

My friend and I left full but irritated. If I thought the quality of service was a one time thing I wouldn't even put this review up...but the fact of the matter is when you are paying for overpriced Mexican food in North Scottsdale, it isn't as if your options are slim.

I can tell you after living in Japan for five years that Sushi Ken is right up there with all my favorite sushi restaurants in Japan.  Sushi ken is comparable to all the cozy ""mom and pop"" shops in Japan, who I consider to all be 4 and 5 star ratings. 

 I've visited Sushi Ken numerous times, usually on Friday or Saturday nights and it's often busy, but if your patient enough to wait a few minutes or so; then you'll be glad you did, because the culinary experience you're about to encounter is out of this world.  

One particular item on the menu that fits my ""out of this world"" category is the ""chunky spicy tuna roll.""  This is by far my most favorite roll in all of Phoenix.  I've had spicy tuna roll at Sakana, Ra, Kona Grill, sakitini, Ichi Ban, Kabuki...I could go on and on, but no one else's spicy tuna roll even comes close to Sushi Ken's chunky spicy tuna roll.  So if you don't want to go on and on and just want to find a great place for spicy tuna roll with:

- Generous 8 piece portions
 -Fresh tuna 
 -Soft rice
 -Sushi Ken's own hot spice 
 -Tasty seaweed
 -Masago (smelt row) 
 -Extra wasabi and ginger on the side
  -Reasonable and affordable cost of $8.75

- then look no further, because Sushi Ken will provide you with all those criteria's.  
 Aside from Sushi Ken having great chunky spicy tuna roll, they also have friendly staff, nice atmosphere and many sushi and non-sushi items on the menu to choose from for those who are not into sushi, and all at an affordable price that won't break your wallet.  Oh yeah, you'll also get complimentary miso soup and edamame.  You can't beat that!",review,fytQ4lPYbvzbzy6M4TIQ-g,0,0,0,9

The carne asada beef tacos were divine. Really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle.

One thing I would like to see them do, and maybe I've overlooked it, is carry some actual vinyl albums, but there is only so much space, but that seems like it would fit with the overall ethos of this fine establishment.",review,aIAjAU-6NH583EkQ6E9KRw,0,0,0,9

I am from Rhode Island and Italian food is at our fingertips, and in Arizona, there are few and far between authentic non chain Italian restaurants. I feel that although ambiance is important, I didn't see anything wrong with Lo Cascio's. There were no cheesy paper protectors over a linen table cloth, and there were no paper place mats with several business names, so not sure what the issue was there. And as far as the music....I would be annoyed too if I had to work there every night, but again, it only added to the atmosphere. In my opinion, some of the best Italian food does not come with yuppie atmosphere.
  For the appetizer we had the fried mozzarella which my husband and I enjoyed very much. The marinara poured over it was on the chunkier side and I loved it because it tasted just like a sauce an old Italian friend of mine made. It was perfect. I had eggplant parmesan for my entree, and it tasted just like NYC Italian. The eggplant didn't have the shit fried out of it, and it had the finest light coating just the way I love my favorite dish. And my husband had veal milanese which was out of this world. It was in a sauce of lemon and wine, mushrooms and artichokes.
  I also want to mention, we had the most Attentive waitress that I have ever had. Her name is Katie, and she was very sweet always asking us after each course if we needed anything and how everything tasted.
  We will definitely be back here, we live down the road now in our new home and I am very happy there is a great little Italian restaurant nearby. I am also happy I didn't let the negative reviews scare me.",review,DFQ95g3s1oi-VcDZEO2TOA,1,3,0,9

HAPPY HOUR ON A SATURDAY!!!

Yes, every day actually! from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour too starting at 10pm!! How can that be true??? Well I guess in Arizona they know how to party! $11 pitchers and $3 pints, yes it could be a little cheaper, but hey it is a happy hour every day of the week! And their beer is really good! AND they will give you FREE samples of all of their beer too!!! This is like brewery heaven!!!

To top it off, a group of people came here in Crank or Drank shirts on their first ever biking and drinking tours and this was on their tour for good reason! Their Hefe is awesome, complete with lemon wedges of course, and their Sunbru was so so refreshing on that hot day in AZ! Adriana and I definitely had our fair share of pitchers, along with an order of their beer battered fries and their specialty ice cream cake! Well, that was actually roopas, and just an FYI, oreo crumb crust and Hefe don't really mix......so save the cake for when you are done drinking ha ha

But the waiters here (the ones that don't look like they are 15!!!!!) are helpful and friendly and nice, and you will definitely get carded here, even though literally I actually felt old here since all the girls look so young! Some of them must have had workers permits I swear!

Since I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!

The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.

Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.

I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off.

I began with the Squid Salad. A more than generous portion of Squid I thought for the price. It was cooked and marinated quite nicely. Next up, the main dish. The Tempura came on the side as 2 Shrimp Tempura and a piece of Carrot Tempura. The Tempura batter was actually quite nice, no complaints there. Now for the Soba. It came in a huge piping hot bowl. The broth was very clean, fresh, and enjoyable. The Soba Noodles tasted good I thought. I can't give a comparison to other Soba Noodles though, so I don't know if they were great of terrible as far as Soba is concerned, but I had no complaints. This is one of those things where I have to try numerous Soba Noodles to make a valid argument. But as far as I'm concerned it didn't disappoint.

6rijZ1qIjiq1Dgdy35iqxw,2010-04-17,LlFBX3JltdgEkLnY6rFiOw,5,"Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult 1 1/2 mile hike (Just up, 3 miles total) that I have ever been on. While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half. 

The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking. You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at: 

http://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.png

The walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-25 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else. 

The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment. There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike. 

The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is. There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time. This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.

The rest at the top is wonderful. The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit. The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long. 

Be careful on the way back. It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon. Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.

Don't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside.",review,wtz3H1UWW4V5nuZfRWDsSA,2,2,0,9

Came for Arizona Restaurant Week 2010. I would have never, ever picked this restaurant based on it's name. I do not eat steak, nor will I ever eat steak, but my friend wanted to go so I agreed since there were non-steak items on the Restaurant Week menu. I'm so happy we did! 

For the first course, I debated between the crispy shrimp and the chopped salad and based on the waiters recommendation, I ordered the chopped salad with avocado, crispy vegetables and parmesan. Loved the huge chunks of avocado in it! 

For the second course, I ordered the tortelli (a version of tortellini). It was the perfect size, not too big, not too small. Enough for one person. It was delicious! It was stuffed with artichoke and cheese and was heavenly. I wish I had the recipe so I could attempt to make it at home. 

The dessert of Peanut Butter Cup was equally delicious. It's not what you'd expect it to be: it's smooth and creamy with a hint of chocolate, but it's damn good! I was so full from my meal and couldn't finish all of it so I asked the waiter to scoop it out into a to-go box for me and he laughed, but happily packed it up. I didn't wanna waste any of that peanut butter goodness! 

I'm so surprised in Modern Steak. I'm glad I gave it a chance, despite it's namesake. I'll definitely go back and tell all my friends about it too.",review,pWTUeXZKI6oJ78WTET5y2A,1,3,0,9

Tanked Fish to the rescue! I will now drive the irritating 15+ miles out of my way to eat here on a weeknight, whenever he can break free from his wife and two cute little kids (he wouldn't approve of the way I word that, for the record). 

I'm concerned that the high ratings this place has gotten so far will lead to false expectations. I love Tanked Fish for two very simple reasons: I always have a great time, and I always stuff my face with sushi until I can eat no more. One night we came here, ate more sushi than we needed to, had a large beer or two, and the bill for all of this... two of us... came to TWENTY SIX DOLLARS. I'm sorry folks but there are very few places on earth where this is possible. [Note: This was during a weeknight happy hour special]

A snooty sushi connaisseur would probably tell you that something is wrong with the quality of the sushi. I can't. It tastes good. It has some large tables and would be a great place to bring a large group (6-8 people). As for the vibe of the place, although it has some nice trendy decor it's still more of a neighborhood bar than a destination unto itself, I would say. So don't walk into here expecting Ahwatukee's answer to Nobu (and then whine about it on Yelp and complain that Phoenix is not as cool as, say, Chicago). If your needs are very simple, and they are to stuff your face with sushi and have a good time shootin' the breeze with your buds, Tanked Fish will meet them.",review,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw,6,7,0,9

I've been a huge fan of Houston's for years, and had mixed emotions when I heard that they were closing the Phoenix location and opening just down the street under their parent company name, Hillstone.  But after one visit, I'm sold... 

Hillstone has the same favorite dishes that Houston's had (spinach dip, grilled artichoke, veggie burger, fresh vegetable sides, fries, desserts, etc...) and they have a huge wine list as well.  Service is attentive and sweet (thanks McKenna who was our waitress last night).  Thanks also for going above and beyond and creating rootbeer floats for our table upon request!

The Hillstone group did a fabulous job building this new restaurant - it's got a great outdoor seating area, a huge bar, an awesome wine cellar, and comfy booths inside as well.

If you still want the old name (Houston's), the location in Scottsdale / Hilton Village is still open, but I highly recommend checking out Hillstone to change it up just a bit.

We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.

You can't see this place from the street. It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange. It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop. As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there. Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, ""what can i get for you..."" Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.

I gotta have my lattes. I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte. Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks. Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee. The latte here was PERFECT. The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte. Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it. Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes. This is my new coffee place.

Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop. Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine. Skip the Starbucks and ""Sex in the City"" sorority girl drinks and come here.

Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large. That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion. Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte.",review,LHQ2fuC2RDS-Md_dN2O1IQ,0,1,0,9

Our server was very friendly and informative, yet also gave us space. We ordered crab cakes to start things off. They were excellent but slightly over priced given the portion size. Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec. We decided on this bottle after our server brought us several other tastes.

Server was very nice although stumbled over the bar order [and it turned out they made a scotch substition that they made no mention of]. Had I not already done my yelp research I would have been at a loss as to what to order. We skipped the apps and had the swordfish and the pork. Swordfish was a fine attempt but I thought over citrified and small bit over cooked. The pork tacos were genius. The combination of the pork, the sauce and the accompanying red onion, queso and cilantro on the home made corn tortilla just sang. The pork arrived as a glistening chunk that falls apart. Well worth the $32 and meant for two. You can also ask for more of the tortillas. 

We shared the churros and milkshake for dessert. DEEEVINE. Warm chocolate churros sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and an amazing milk shake that we really enjoyed. 

I'd go back and sit outside by the fire and eat the apps and have drinks Plates are small to begin with and I think if you expect a crazy WOW dining experience, you'll be disappointed.

It's a very flavorful dish, however the individual tastes are all mushed together.  The noodles are a bit tough for me; perhaps undercooked.  However some people like it a bit tough.  

Gourmet Jumbo Crab Ravioli:  There's not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish.  The edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry.  I did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli.  The creamy sauce was not bad and it wasn't too overpowering in my mouth.  It was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab.  

Baked Lasagna:  This is the best of the 3 I've had.  It has 4 kinds of cheese, ground beef, and pork.  First of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna. Then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce.  You may have to remove some of the sauce if it's too much for you.  The noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste, but it was still able to hold its shape.  And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish.  

I do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream.  It's a great blend of pistachio, chocolate and strawberry.  And it's just the right amount after a large meal.  Maybe one of these days I'll go back just to try their chocolate desserts.  

If you like an American spin on Italian food, then you would like this place.  It's a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if you're crunched for time.  But the food is just average and not that special.",review,HpKLR1mrb634jCnTXQr3aA,0,0,0,9

I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasn't impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio.

It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldn't find here. 

FUN.

To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I don't go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. It's like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace.

I came here expecting a fun bar that wasn't a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Don't get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I don't go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I can't hate on it.

Bonnie 
Tea Infusion 
 

It was Bonnie's choice to grab some drinks at what she described as a ""great, independently owned tea shop"" located at Tempe Marketplace. I'm not a tea connoisseur by any means, and I generally distrust fads (i.e., this silly-sounding thing called ""boba"" tea), but I agreed cause if  Bonnie likes it, it's gotta be worth checking out, right? 


Parking wasn't too much of a hassle on a Sunday afternoon, and we surprisingly got a space close to an entrance to the ""District,"" just outside of Barnes and Noble. Inside, the shop looked much like a Starbucks - and I don't mean to imply that it was uninspired or anything. It was clean, modern and consisted of a long counter behind which two employees busily hand-mixed tea and smoothie concoctions, along with a few tables/chairs. 


The menu was extensive and separated into ""black,"" ""green"" and ""white"" teas, any of which I could get hot or cold...I think. I picked the tropics white in iced form, and B got my second choice, a peach mix white. Both were pretty delicious. There was also a selection of sandwiches and snacks that I did not sample - next time. I also ran into a good friend there who was delighted by the fact that they had this mystical ""boba,"" and so ordered a Chai-type version with blueberry-sized and -shaped balls floating on the bottom, and an oversized straw to facilitate sucking them up along with the drink. I tried one boba ball and it was gelatinous and chewy - not at all like what I expected - and an odd sensation, but I would totally order one the next time I'm in. 


Being in the District and flanked by stores like ""Hottie Inc."" and Guess, there were several teens inside hanging out in large numbers - boo. So, we decided to sit outside for as long as we could stand it. I was surprised to find that the several shaded tables and misters made for a pretty comfortable environment, and we hung out for a good hour or so before I got so sweaty I have to get mobile.  


So, in summary, I would totally come back. Probably before or after a movie, to grab a drink and support an independent store among a mecca of chain retail. Plus, right across the way there is an ASU art gallery (closed Sunday and Monday) that we peeked into and actually cool, interesting sculpture art by local artist and asu instructor David Young.

Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  

Some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.

The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.

I love that while this location is in a nice part of town, it's not quite the same level of frou-frou as many other spots.  That means rather than dealing with the Scottsdale types who have to dress up to go to the store - you're dealing with a greater range of folks - but they are all willing to pay a bit more for the good stuff.  I will say, you'll pay less for a box of cereal or box of triscuits at a Circle K than you will at an AJ's. And I don't think I've ever seen anything on sale.  

But there is just nothing like their fresh food.  Be it produce or the meat section, the colors are brighter, the items are bigger and you just know it's going to taste better.  Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good, and so large, you want to eat them all at once, but you just can't.  You have to try some of their pre-prepped meats.  My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing.  Wow. 

And of course, great pre-made foods too if you just want to pick up something to go.  I've been suckered in to their desert section far too many times.  And they are always good.  But dang they can be pricy - so it really has to just be a special splurge.  

If you haven't tried an AJ's yet, I suggest this one to ease you into things.   There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot, but there won't be too many Hummers.",review,l53FUDHRHLg7BQ89KgAtxQ,2,0,1,9

However, when we entered the hotel, we were brusquely directed to the bar entrance.  Having been to the restaurant before, I wandered out to check the dining room.  I was immediately turned back at the entrance and told the dining room was ""reservations only.""

Well, the bar has maybe 5 tables, and there were nearly 100 riders.  People who have just completed a 10-mile+ bike ride want to eat, drink, and be seated, not stand 5 deep in a bar line and then stand around holding their drinks.  We were not even sure we'd be able to order food.  We left almost immediately and went across the street to Portlands.  Right after we'd ordered, we saw another group of bikers headed to Carly's.

It seems everyone that works at Yogis Grill just seems uninterested and lacks the ability to be friendly. *shrug* Its not overly bothersome to me but it would be nice to have friendlier service. 2. Their sushi, is not that good and they are ridiculously over priced. I can go to Kona Grill which is a nice restaurant and get much better tasting sushi for nearly $2.00 cheaper!

Rock-n-Roll Fingers is a SO cool concept.  Chicken fingers, waffle fries and Texas toast - that's pretty much the menu.  The Chicken fingers may be fried or Buffalo style - but they definitely won't be from frozen chicken.  They use only fresh Chicken breasts - no skin and no bones -  and they fry only in Canola oil to make for the least unhealthy fried chicken they can.  They have about 7 different dipping sauces - from Ranch to Thai sweet chili  - though they are known for their Special Sauce.  It's a secret recipe, so of course I had to try it.  Pretty dang good.  I also loved the BBQ which was more tangy than sweet and went perfect with the chicken.  

As for the chicken - have you ever had chicken so juicy that you though it might not be fully cooked?  Maybe it's just because I grew up eating overcooked food, but every once in awhile when I get chicken cooked so perfectly I have to look to make sure it isn't pink.  It was SO juicy I was really shocked.  And though fried, it wasn't a thick and overly crispy batter - just enough to seal in the juices while leaving you with a tender and flexible piece of meat.  The waffle fries were out of this world.  The Texas toast was SOOO good!  

When I got back to the office I was super excited to learn two things.  This is an independently owned business - this is their first location.  And even more cool - they have gotten a perfect score by the Health Department more than six times in a row.  Wow.

The food was excellent, the Ropa Viejo nice and tender. The Paradise Pork (I think that's what it was) was also very good. And didn't taste like a pig. (The only good part of a pig for me is the other food group: BACON!)

A big drawback is that while half of the seats face the lovely paintings the other half face the kitchen.  

The wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places.  The bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form.  They do offer 8 oz pours of wine for about $15 a glass.  Be careful when you order, as we were given 8oz pours and had no idea we were getting them.  

The food was quite good, they actually had real grilled focaccia and this garlic cream butter that was delicious.  Its tapas style and we ordered three and it was more than enough for the two of us. All of the tapas we ordered were well prepared. We also ordered dessert which was very mediocre.

Although I get the same thing every time i have on occasion tried other items that people with me have ordered. All the chicken entries are good, the same lightly fried chicken just different sauces (general tso is my 2nd favorite). The beef dishes are terrible. The seafood is just ok. The won ton soup is really good as well and is usually the second thing i will order if orange chicken isn't enough. I cant remember if the pork is any good but the won ton soup has pork in it so i would give it a shot if you like pork far more than chicken. 

The owners and servers are a bit jaded by the high school students that frequent the place during lunch but will warm up quickly if you go in there a few times. Food comes fast by the way so make sure that when you get take out that you let them know if you will take more than 5 minutes otherwise it will be done and waiting for you after 5 minutes.

This place is definitely trying to pull off cool and I think they do a pretty good job of it.  Their expansive selection of Tequila, enhances the mood they set out to create.

I do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was, so I think it evens out.  

They might charge for chips because it's the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn't be profitable.  I say this because their alcohol is a good deal.  16 oz. Dos Equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn't happy hour!

This place is a balance of modestly priced mexican, drinking and nice atmosphere.  The food is not amazing but it's good, and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at 11 at night this restaurant/bar is overall impressive.

After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!

It was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!). 

 Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. 

We ordered:
Somosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).
Naan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)
Grilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).

We each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. 

I ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).

Husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. 

Next time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things. 

$35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us.",review,HvaVgP0S0dFaCbBDIQIkag,0,0,0,9

Typically, when you respond to ads like that from a gym, the staff requests your information such as name, address, & phone so they can sell you on a membership later. That was not the case with me. It was very informal. I advised I was not a member and wanted to give their place a shot. The guy in the front desk said come right on in; no personal information requested and no tour. I'm glad there was no sales pressure. I thought the no tour part was kind of odd, but after doing my walk through, I understand why. The place is not very big. They have weights and cardio machines and the treadmills each had a personal television on the machine. The whole facility appeared clean and there were free towels for the taking for your workout. The lockers in the men's locker room were really nice. They were made brown wood. You can view a sample of the interior of the facility on their website. They looked really classy, but they were not free. There were cabinets offered outside of the locker rooms that you can keep your personals in with a latch that allows you to insert your personal lock on. There was also a small room for classes.

I wasn't very impressed with this gym mainly because it was very small. I came during a Sunday afternoon when most gyms don't see much traffic so I don't know what it's like during normal high traffic periods such as early mornings and after 5pm on weekdays. I would imagine that due to the small size of this gym that they cater more to the very local crowd. I wouldn't give this location a poor rating because there wasn't really anything that stood out that was negative other than the limited space and equipment. You might think of this location as the alternative to the larger chain gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, or Lifetime Fitness.

There was a refrigerator in the room which I used to stock water and bubbly from the Safeway down the road (the hotel is very convenient to many restaurants and shops).  One of the best things was that the wake up call was a good old fashined person, not a machine, and she offered to call me back--gotta love a live snooze button! When I went to check out, the folio on the TV showed charges, so I called downstairs, explained I had prepaid the package, and the front desk people solved the issue very quickly to my satisfaction.  Also, they have machines by the front desk that allow you to check in and print your boarding pass.
My one complaint and why I did not give it a fifth star: charging for internet.  Seriously, in this day and age, that to me felt like it was nickling and diming the guests, many who pay a lot to stay at the resort.
For those who go to Scottsdale, I definitely recommend the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch (and check out the Hyatt Vacations website for some good deals).

UPDATE: I checked my cc bill three days later and they had double charged me after all, despite giving me a zeroed out receipt.  Poor form, Hyatt.  She credited back to me, but what if I hadn't noticed?",review,2_31RaL6kz0vRQX41g9iXw,3,4,0,9

At my friends suggestion, I tried the butter burger deluxe, fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called, but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard.
The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double), the lettuce was crisp, tomatoes fresh, bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful!
I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape, and full of salty cheesy goodness.
The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces, but there was a mixup, but I had no complaints).
I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I can't wait to go next time so I can try something new. 
The thing I didn't like was the bible verses all over the walls.

Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown. 
We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best. 
Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread. 
Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great. 
I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.

i always go for the blazin buffalo because i eat wing sauce on nearly everything. boars head meats on all their sandwiches which is great but jacks the price up quit a bit. a sandwich, drink, and a side was about $10. i went with the pasta salad as a side, which was nothing special, your average run of the mill pasta salad. my sandwich on this particular visit was lacking a sufficient amount of buffalo sauce and i neglected to ask for extra before i left, assuming that they wouldn't be stingy with it. the bread is good, they toast it so it tends to get soggy if you take it to go. the bread bowls are good too, i've had the clam chowder and chicken noodle and i recommend both.

service here is usually quite slow. even when it's not busy in there, like today around 2, i had to wait 10 minutes to get my sandwich and even saw some guy who was two people behind me get his order before me. when it's busy, you're going to be waiting even longer. they need to pick up the pace.",review,HY9qpAamqLXFoa7xMwNntg,1,1,0,9

The waffles were alright, I can't say I am the biggest waffle fan, but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice. I think the waffles could have been better in my opinion.
