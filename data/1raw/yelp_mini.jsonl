{"text":"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\n\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.\n\nAnyway, I can't wait to go back!","stars":5}
{"text":"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.\n\nIn any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!\n\nWe had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.","stars":5}

It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.\n\nThe Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.\n\nThe fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!","stars":5}

{"text":"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.\n\nMy friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.\n\nThe entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.\n\nIf the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.","stars":4}
{"text":"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.\n\nThis cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!\n\nIt looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!\n\nAs if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.","stars":5}

The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.","stars":5}
{"text":"Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.","stars":5}
{"text":"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.  \n\nThe 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.","stars":5}
{"text":"Good tattoo shop. Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide who's style most mirrors what you're looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. He's a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while he's working on you, and he doesn't dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). He's very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft.","stars":4}
{"text":"I'm 2 weeks new to Phoenix. I looked up Irish bars in town and found Rosie's. The decor and ambience was outstanding. I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! \n\nThe basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.\n\n\nAll the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming. I am sure I will see a bunch (or all) of them again and I look forward to that!","stars":4}
{"text":"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying \"x large pizza and large salad only 23$\". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. \n\nTo the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. \n\nAnd your salads are severely overpriced \n\nWon't go back unless I'm desperate.","stars":2}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!\n\nNext up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are \"seasoned\" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.\n\nMy entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.\n\nIt wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.","stars":3}

{"text":"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. \n\nLoved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. \n\nInside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of \"Dusk Till Dawn\". \n\nWe were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? \nWe weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. \n\nAnyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) \nThere is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.\n\nFor $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. \nThere was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. \n\nMy Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.\n\nI'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.","stars":3}
{"text":"They've gotten better and better for me in the time since this review was written. \n\nMy last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one.\n\nI think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started. It still tends to suck if you aren't Ascent club (like just about any budget-centric airline does), but once you get there it's a good value. When I've had to fly Southwest or USAir I've been disappointed in comparison.","stars":4}

I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. \n\nThey run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go.","stars":3}

{"text":"This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.\n\nThe menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!\n\nAnyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!","stars":4}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. \nI have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. \nOnce, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!","stars":5}
{"text":"Not that my review will mean much given the more in-depth reviewers but I will chime in nonetheless...\n\nI can really only review one dish, the #3 lunch special, Yellow Curry Chicken. I don't know what the authentic name for it is, Kang Karee something or other. It's so tasty that the first time I had it I knew I'd never branch out. Good lunch spot if you work around downtown. Not the quickest service all the time and can get busy during lunch, but always consistently good. Fairly dim inside, a good place to forget about the sun on a summer day.","stars":4}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.","stars":4}

I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.\n\nI should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.","stars":5}

After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.","stars":1}
{"text":"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!\n\nTIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.","stars":5}

I prefer the former but those who prefer the latter won't agree with my review.\n\nI thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance... I would rather have something with more character but I'm glad I tried this place out.","stars":3}
