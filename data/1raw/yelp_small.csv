The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.

Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.

While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best ""toast"" I've ever had.

In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!

We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",review,0a2KyEL0d3Yb1V6aivbIuQ,0,0,0

Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",review,sqYN3lNgvPbPCTRsMFu27g,4,3,1

This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!

It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!

As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.

I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! 

The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.

We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying ""x large pizza and large salad only 23$"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied.

They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!

Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are ""seasoned"" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.

My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good.

The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.

I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min).

I thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance...

Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.
If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",review,iwUN95LIaEr75TZE_JC6bg,0,4,3

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

I thought to myself, ""how nice"", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.

So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a ""different"" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",review,J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ,1,2,1

This place is definitely good for what it is, ""it"" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to ""reduce costs"" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.

On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). 

I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).

For those claiming to be ""left to fend for themselves"" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called ""the menu"" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as ""descriptions"" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand?

FCcFT610nQBVcRdY-devQA,2012-01-14,6jRs2P6zTYMn36fVnCu1Zw,4,"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

I just can't believe the things that happened!!

Yes the app was good.  The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!

But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!

When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.

I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  
I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!

When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.

When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.",review,UL9chyH0a4Pj8J_9M6WSpA,1,2,2

La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!

No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming. You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!

The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of ""fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas...

The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.

I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.

I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.


So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:

*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.

*Spicy Buffalo ""Wings"": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the ""wings"". This dish is a must try!!

*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.

*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!

Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.


Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving ""meat"" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.

Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). 

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.",review,HY9qpAamqLXFoa7xMwNntg,1,1,3

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.
 I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.

The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :)

None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.

It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.

Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30.

Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.

We started with the Gambas al Fuego, which were deliciously spicy (although I thought that $10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive, no matter how tasty they were). We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.

If it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future.

Betito's moved in, and they're okay. The wife and I stopped in yesterday. I had a carne asada torta and a taco and both were about average. Their hot salsa took it up a notch though. My wife had something with diablo in the name (sorry, I'll have to look at the menu when I get home) and loved it. They do the usual menudo on weekends and the whole place is more or less along the lines of a Filiberto's--not that there's anything wrong with that. The whole bill was less that $20, so prices are good. 

Clean enough place, cheap, food is okay, and service is adequate. I would not go out of my way to get there, but if it is in your neighborhood it is worth a try. I'll probably stop here from time to time.",review,1wMGLaMIH7CcmJ2htS1rmw,1,1,0

However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!

When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.

Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night. 

This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said ""show me your favorite."" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.

What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.

When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). 

It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!

The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.

Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. 

I had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? 

The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good.

Nice laid back decor too.

You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.

I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!

I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!

The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)

You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.

Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.

They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.

Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not.

It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. 

The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of ""everything is good, just order something so I can go home"". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. 

It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back.

The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.

Rumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road.

The ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact ""Jesus"".  LOL.

Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of ""what are YOU doing here?"" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.

I'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.

The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!

I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.

Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it ""phat si iew"") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.

The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.

The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.

My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.

The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.

Things I do not love: 
Service. Are you a bouncer? A bartender? Are you leading me to a seat? can you get me a seat? Its confusing. The staff is not clearly defined (not only do they not wear uniforms, or name tags, but they are scarce and hard to find) 
The mix. It is kind of a random mix. I guess that can be a good thing, but I was there once and it was like Spring Break in Cabo, and then the other time, it was like 50+ snow birds day. Either one is fine, it is just hard to gage when to go and who to bring, like, my mom, or my pals. 
They serve dessert, but no coffee. That, to me, is just strange. Buy a coffee maker. Sheesh. They have this amazing fondue that would be great with some baileys and coffee, and alas, no coffee. Strange. I know, ""wine bar"", but if you serve dessert, coffee should go hand in hand.

I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had ""reserved"" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. 

The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. 

The food is best described as ""home cooking"". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? 

Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself.

Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. 

The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.

Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. 

I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.

I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9.

Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.

The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)

The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!""

On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.",review,mQba83gB018LlGt51r80ZQ,1,2,1

Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.

--hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice
--crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab
--tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting
--side salad for ciabatta ""sandwich"" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame!
--chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese

Now, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist!

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb.  Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. 

The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me.

I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",review,8qe2c5uRlAkvNFvDriBm1Q,0,2,0

Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.",review,80PHOfM8KOBb7xEQN4C0lg,0,0,0

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.

Impressive architecture and design (it is also mostly functional)!  
The seats are roomier than expected and the rows have just enough room between them to allow people to pass relatively easily in front of you without having to stand up to let them through.[Relative to US Airways Center seats which outside of Lexus Club and courtside seats are several inches narrower than the ones at Gammage and you have to stand up every time someone needs to pass.]
Having the room to pass easily is nice, especially if you are seated in the middle of the auditorium, since you have to pass in front of at least 30 people just to get to your seat if your, say, running late or need to escape to the restroom.

Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!

I've since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.  First time, had great food (all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal, seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out).  Great although somewhat minimal service for the second half of our dinner, former waiter did not say he was leaving, we sat for a little while before someone new arrived.

Famous Dave's is fine.  There are two of them I know of, and I've been to both.  They're both fine.

We visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK.

The brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didn't have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasn't severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor.

And a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their 'for sale' bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, it's just ""not right"".  That's not how BBQ is done.

Anyway, Famous Dave's is really nothing special.  The BBQ is ""OK"", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joe's, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joe's, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Tom's BBQ, that's for sure (see my review of Tom's...truly awful).  And the beans and fries are pretty good.",review,Mb0psF4WQF7gZSuZafVr-g,1,1,0

Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.

Chinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.

There was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away.",review,Ps1Db9zOatoF_76FZNO5CQ,0,3,0

It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice.

1. The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. 
2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. 
3. The massage was pretty weak. 
4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. 
5. It was difficult to make an appointment here. I had to call several times and leave messages and wait for them to call me back.

Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- 
"" No problem "" we were told , come on down. 

arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- 

Note to the great state of Arizona : 

(the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) .

we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that "" he had already set a table for us inside""- 

upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio  he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. 

this puzzled my wife who then surmised that : 

A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio

B) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill 
                                      ( there was) 
                 
after taking our drink order ,(competently),  he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types ""hot "" or ""regular""-
there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared  to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -??  the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...???

when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied: 
"" I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food"" 

????????????????? 

Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? 

The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding.

The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold--

Firstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). 

It was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.

I had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.

My girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. 

The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. 

I would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.",review,K46kUag6aS0Vd4JjiaqNsQ,0,0,0

I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. 

Breakfast: 

Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. 

Lunch:

Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind.

vxPPpj5jJKO8DtapF5S-NQ,2009-06-05,MMt47JTaLAmrbf4d_ATCPA,4,"Wow, not what we were expecting at all. But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a ""Dive"" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.

But after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.

Every culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!

A kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.

Now this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.

Don't expect to find the standard ""Mexican Restaurant"" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.

We had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.

We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.

To finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Crème Fraîche that was also a hit.

The owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.

As I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.

They serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.

I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!

I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!

I ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!

We also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!

For my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was ""stuffed."" Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion. 

We definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.

The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people ""off"" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.

We would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out.

well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.

so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash, lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?

i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.

The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. 

We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night.

First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)

Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!

Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.

He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.

Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth?

This is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill 'er up at the fountain yourself. I wasn't sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked ""how big is the salad"" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a ""size"" with their hands and shrug and say, ""i don't know... about like this?"" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a ""mound"" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. 

When I ordered ""just water"" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, ""you know what? Just take a regular glass, it's more comfortable...."" He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor's office, when you order water.

I really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because I'll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.

The caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was ""perfect"" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful.

The cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.

Granted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, I'm spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonno's in NYC's upper east side. But still, darn good. I'd eat it again. (I took some home and it didn't look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).

Brett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious. 

And the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. 

Great food - great service - great vibe. I hope this place sticks around.

Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?

So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. 

Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night?

(I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) 

We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.

We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)

Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!

We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. 

I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce.

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.

It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  

When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.

I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.

First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.

Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.

Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.

Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   

Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.
No value

Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.
My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.

Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.

Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!",review,zNR8Q6Fw9UvlVSgxwEy-3Q,3,10,1

There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"".

He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...""vote with your feet""...but I guess that's another review.

The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!

At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.

Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.

So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!

I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!

I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!

We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!

Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!

The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?""

I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.

I like to ""fit in"".

The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.

I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).

I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!

I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!",review,du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g,13,9,16

Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and I'd come back to try more but here's what our first visit was like.

As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.

My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ];

THE GOOD: 
* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. 
* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere
* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.

THE BAD:
* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.
* A surly ""aunty type"" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids
* Said ""aunty type"" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.
* Said ""aunty type"" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.
* Said ""aunty type"" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?
* Said ""aunty type"" doesn't say ""thank you"", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.

THE UGLY:
* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? 

So, in the end, here's the equation:

1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.

It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly.

After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My ""corner"", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.
Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. 
After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.
After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.
I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.
I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!
I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.",review,T2YhY--VPurB8rPJ-Q5giw,2,3,2

Place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like I did on a previous visit. In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail.

While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try! 

Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of. 

Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge ""by the glass"" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!

Mom and I missed our reservation at Cowboy Ciao's on a Friday night and a worker recommended us to visit the sister restaurant ""Kazimierz."" Ok, we'll go as long as they have the famous Stetson Chopped salad. My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao.

So we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker. We were seating within a couple of minutes. Mann.. we had to hold up the candle to read the menu. The environment is nice if you are just spending time with your friends and chatting. But to eat and see your food?? The darkness is not good for that.

Anyway, we had the Stetson Chopped salad ($12). It was sooo good with the smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, pepita mixture, and the greens. Yummy!

The Burgundian Flatbread ($13) was also delicious! I liked the crispy crust and the chunks of brie!! Wow!! The morels and the shallots gave the flatbread some sweetness.

This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself.

Drinks
1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice. 
2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.

it hurts my lungs to breath.

I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.
The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!!
~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*

I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.
I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.

For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.

Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.
Very little hands-on and help with internships.
Way too much groupwork and free-riding.
They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.

Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.
They have their teaching assistants teach us.

Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.
 Junior year when you get admitted into the ""professional program"" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.

The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)

There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.
The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.

Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.
Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.

Expect to wait in line wherever you go.
ASU accepts way too many people.
It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.

Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.
The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.
They are not informed enough to advise you.

I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.
I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.

Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.
Gross!!

One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.

The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.

ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.
I have been approached by many shady people.

do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus.
They are beyond crappy and overpriced.
You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.
The ""freshman year experience"" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.
and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).

I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.

Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student.

They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.

It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.

But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. 

It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. 

You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. 

This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway.

The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  

Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  

I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.

Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).

We were seated quickly, which was great because there was only 15 minutes left for happy hour and we wanted to get our order in before it ended.  Our waitress was SOOO... nice!  She had a great personality and was attentive and informative, pretty much everything you would want in a waitress.

We ordered everything off the happy hour menu, so I can't comment on the main menu, but the happy hour food was great!  The Hubs and I shared the pork tacos and chicken tacos - he loved the chicken and I loved the pork - go figure.  We shared guacamole, which was good, but needed a bit more seasoning.  By adding the salsa, which was served with it, it became quite good.  BTW, love the unique ""chips"" that are served here... some of our had a ton of seasoning and others had only a little - we liked the ones with just a little.  We also shared the empanadas (I think that's what they were), anyway they were really good.

Overall, we had a great happy hour experience here.  It thoroughly redeemed my not so enthusiastic impression from the Yelp event here (just about the food, not the event).  I can't say enough great things about our waitress - can't remember her name, but she was awesome.  I am sure we will be back soon to try out their main menu.",review,f1-pIw_p0ifzu03TXjPRiw,2,1,1

We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.

--colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail;
--dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above;
--this place and the adjacent ranch market are a ""must-do"" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here);

--Don't miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one ""portion"" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference;
--grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows);
--both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans;
--juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; ""asada"" goodness knows no bounds;
--guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THAT'S what I'm TALKing about !!!
--table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn;
--try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas.
--no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!)

--pork was a bit dry; is ""gamey"" possible in pork?
--server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go.

After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more!

If you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room.

Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.""

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan.""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.""  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy.""

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again.""",review,P2kVk4cIWyK4e4h14RhK-Q,22,23,27

Anyway... I'm a huge fan of brunch (and especially of Mexican/Latin American-type brunches), so I was thrilled to try this place. My friend ordered the Verde Vaqueros, which are their verison of biscuits and gravy. But the biscuits are no ordinary biscuits, they're Green chile beer biscuits (!) with smoked sausage gravy from Schreiners. The biscuits were delicious. I could eat them with anything... or really without anything else. My friend cleaned his plate. I got the stacked chicken enchiladas because I'm a sucker for anything with hatch chiles, and they did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful, and the crispy tortillas were a nice texture contrast to the rest of the dish.

We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!

The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that!

Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?).

After a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off). 

We asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.

Our waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. 

Looking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying ""I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!"" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.

The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

Then, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.",review,sA0sK9l9VxsynxvrOgmBXQ,0,0,0

Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. 

Experiences with the order could be as follows: 
Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. 
Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. 
Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. 
Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. 

Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.",review,LMlBCXFVAHdPnSA94jc6PQ,1,2,1

How do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.

I recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!

Advice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.

This is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons. 

First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.

The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.

And, if you're splurging? Go for the salted chocolate chip cookie if they have it. It makes me happy just thinking about it. :-)

This place is great if you have a weekday morning available to come here..or an hour or two on the weekend. The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed. And that's really not how I want to start my weekend off. 

If you can....call in the order for Curbside Pick Up. That way, you can enjoy LGO without the frustration of finding the mythical parking spot, standing in a long line (albeit trendy) and searching for a table with everybody else so you don't have to eat the wonderfulness standing up.",review,wB7YiVcqEWyL7arlVLsa-g,0,0,0

I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.

With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what?

Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! 

The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. 

We just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.",review,thdVzCfKx-DV0zYWqId3pw,0,1,0

My hubby and I have been missing this place since it closed its original restaurant in Cave Creek. We heard it moved to Phoenix and we found it and went there this past week. Unfortunately, it was nothing like the old, hopping, smell good, smokey, fun filled environment of the original SF. 

I can see that they have a lot of regulars and the barkeep knew everyone that walked through the door, which to me,  was very cool, but it just wasn't gelling for me this night I suppose. 

We ordered the deep Fried green chili's and there was soooo much batter  on them, I had to really concentrate hard to find the chili. I ended up peeling all of the batter off of the chili's just to get a small bite. icky.

vZBYSQtTbY9MaYu5qNuU8Q,2008-02-01,s6Gx6KvpjEdbNK_yYVSyhw,5,"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular. 

Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. 

Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.

Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.

And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.

I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there.

Andiamo....

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. 

Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, ""Hey, that sounds good!!"", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? 

If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. 

Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there.

If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.

Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.

I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.

I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.

Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.",review,GF6IArfVHEFAQmwekt7wug,0,1,0

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!",review,EbnK9Tb1iE8Svz2z-QPxNw,0,2,1

I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.

The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. 

So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. 

The waiter:

* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.
* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...""oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano."" Bonus points for knowing that.

Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. 

All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot.

fLtUF61A5WrKIRIaWlf9wg,2009-07-28,yJhmdViCBXMpPtIwT1UbBg,2,"This place could be great, and I've always wanted to like it more than I actually do.  Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.

I have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: 

1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show ""Friends;"" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?

2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, ""yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.""  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.

3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.

Honestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.",review,ykg3-2C-8Vv3K4mVj1iSfA,1,1,0

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.

However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.

Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? 

Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.

[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items.

From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.

While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's ""Smile"" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  

I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?

I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.

Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.

The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)

I'll try it again though. Food was OK, not great.

We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case. 

My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.

Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say.

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.

They use recycled products plates, plastic-ware and drinks in the container they come in (ie a coke in a coke can). The ambiance is awesome. Sweet and funny signs everywhere, reading material, classic rock playing. They only have the radio on but there always seem to be great songs on! They have a large patio out back that is difficult to see from the front but is really nice on a sunny morning. 

I haven't gotten past the breakfast bowls yet. $6 for 6 toppings, potatoes, buttered toast, and jam. Go ahead and eat carnivore, omnivore or herbivore style (not sure if there are vegan options). Seriously, this $6 breakfast bowl would be $12 at other places served on fine china and with silverware! I don't care about accoutrements like that. Especially when the food is so tasty.

Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. 

     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.

     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. 

     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  
Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!",review,QiR2X306Yzd9fuJdKDhkGg,3,2,2

Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).

This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.

I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their ""Burger Daze"", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  

I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat.

I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical. 

the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?) 

the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust.

We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",review,2qnz2y_Z1nDo2HqqfxJxSA,0,0,0

I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...

The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.

The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.

There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.

There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.

A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.

Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. 

Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.

There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. 

I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.

Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!",review,t79B56n8IeVrMNmM4QU2Ow,2,2,2

I couldn't see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasn't. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didn't want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didn't understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didn't have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it.

I also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place? 

The whole experience was perfunctory, but didn't leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!

And it's good for the whole family, oddly enough!

Once you get inside this massive place, you have an upstairs and downstairs. There is a kid's area, a restaurant with fresh fish, a huge women's section and mens, and areas for fishing and boats and hunting and camping and survival and gear for any occasion. You can look at the giant fish tank, climb up a faux rock side for $3, and just be purely entertained for ages. They have snack foods and jerky and sweets. BBQ grills. Do they have guns? I don't know, probably! They have GPS equipment and water bottles and on and on and on. 

It was exhausting in a great way. My camping/outdoors needs tend to be more mimimalist oriented so I prefer an REI. But I like it here a lot.

Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in ""Hawaii-Mode"" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hula's to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.

If you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!

As far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times I've had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.  All the appetizers are great to munch on while you're enjoying your Mai Tai...all thats missing is Hawaiian music, and the sun setting over the ocean :)",review,omuO9FVYAVRTybkSc4a4fw,0,2,0

If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  

Pros - 
1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.
2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.
3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.
4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!
5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. 
6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  
7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.

I went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion, and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around. We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.

Last year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.

It probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.

The salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.

This is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.

The portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.

What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.

The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.

My friend was right.

Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service I've received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit.

No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc. 

The decor has been refreshed, and although I didn't dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before. 

Props to the new management. Well done. I'll be back.

* The house beer, made by Four Peaks, tasted like something made by Four Peaks, which, if you've ever had a beer crafted by Four Peaks, is the sincerest of compliments.

*  The ""G Red"" blended red wine didn't suck.  

*  The Ham and Eggs:  Deviled eggs were quite tasty.  The ham was medium-thickly sliced and put on a stick.  Nicely warmed.  How could you possibly f up ham?

*  Grilled cheese and tomato soup:  Both quite delicious.

* Cheese plate:  Three cheeses with toasted almonds, crackers, dried apricot and apple half.  I've had better cheese.  Not the greatest selections.  Could stand to include a nice blue.

Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.

The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. 

Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things.

I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! 

A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. 

POSITIVE: 

Our waitress was very friendly and chipper. 

NEGATIVE: 

But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the ""shot glass"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. 

The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... 

1) we never got our edamame, 

2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... 

3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. 

POSITIVE: 

She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. 

NEGATIVE: 

No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. 

Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. 

And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... 

POSITIVE: 

For the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last).",review,2KNPtV5E44vAiEr5BvMkUA,3,2,4

Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.

Kim Brush, the owner, was front and center, and welcomed me as I walked in.  She also had a team of people working there that I assume were all training.  They were friendly although it was obvious that I was one of the first customers, so it took longer than necessary to package up my small bag of kettle corn.  The customer before me appeared to have been waiting awhile on her large bag of Puppy Chow (which looked pretty amazing).  The kettle corn I ordered was just the right balance of sweet and salty.  I had to dig deep to exercise my self-control and not demolish the entire bag in one sitting!

I took a menu to go as well, and now as I look at it, I can't wait to go back to try more of the unique gourmet popcorn flavors.  Not only do they have the basics (Buttery and Low Salt), but they have all kinds of savory flavors including several different cheeses, Dill Pickle, Salt & Vinegar, and Southwest Jalapeno.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like ""um...there might be a better way to do this...""

- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?

I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!"" 

I said ""It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion."" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)

She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4"" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone.

The classroom is small seating about 20 people at the most. There were mimosas waiting for us.

We started by making Siamese Kisses. It was all hands on and really fun. The next was a fresh red curry paste. Then we compared the fresh to the store bought brand. What a difference!

Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there). I love her personality...very intense. Never smiles, even when a smile would be just right. But she is still very kind.

Unless I want my sodium intake for the week in 1 day, I would suggest that they move away from the salt.

They are never too busy to smile and give great service when I come through the door.  They have even taken time to share stories and pictures of their own pets.

Second, they understand that some people must take a fiscally conservative approach with the care of their pets.  They discussed all options thoroughly with me and I performed the care that was needed a little at a time -- as it was needed.  This was important to me since many vets that we've visited in the past have handed us an estimate for hundreds or thousands of dollars and wouldn't budge -- insisting that we HAD to do ALL the work listed.  At QC Vet Clinic, I didn't feel like I was judged for that decision.

Unfortunately, we had a small mistake that I discussed with the vet.  She listened and gave appropriate feedback to my concerns.  This is really the only thing that is preventing a 5 star rating.  Overall they are still the best vet I've visited and I will continue to put my pets lives in their very capable hands.

BTW, we had to have a pet put down because he was ill. The team at QC Vet Clinic was absolutely the best!  They were so empathetic and even sent us a sympathy card with a little surprise inside...

This time, the chicken pieces seems to be a little bit bigger than last time. The menu now has a disclaimer saying that some sides may incur an additional charge.  That was two of my gripes on my first visit, so check and check.. 

This time, I ordered an 8pc with 2 large sides...As stated above, chicken was bigger, and it was hot and moist..perfectly seasoned. For sides, I ordered the sweet corn nuggets and mac and cheese. They had run out of mac and cheese and had to make more. It took about 10 minutes to make. Was it worth the wait? It was fresh, REAL macaroni and cheese, baked in the oven, not some ""out of the box"" variety. It was made with real cheese, as witnessed by the stringy cheese when eaten. My comment here is that I prefer a more creamy variety than what it was. But it definitely was better than Kraft mac & cheese in a box. 

The sweet corn nuggets were incredible. Not sure if they are something they make fresh or if it comes out of a freezer bag, but they were delicious little morsels. Nuggets of corn kernals, surrounded by a light crunchy coating and deep fried. 

I wanted to try out their fried shrimp, so I got an ""add on"" of 4 fried shrimp ($1.99). At first view, I was disappointed. What I got were 4 very small (think MAYBE 45-50 sized shrimp). They were not even butterflied, which would have made them appear bigger). But upon tasting them, I really enjoyed the flavor. They appeared to be freshly breaded (is it the same seasoned flour used for the chicken?) and were very tasty. My suggestion here would be to 1) butterfly the shrimp and 2) get a slightly larger shrimp (even if it means a price increase).

Atmosphere: Trendy and hip. Except for the excessive desperate looking cougars trying to cash in on fake rich or really young ripped Jersey Shore looking guys. The cougars are just minor annoyances, they don't get in the way too much. The majority of the people seem to be pretty cool though.

Food: Portions are pretty small, but are decently priced.

Decor: Outstanding! Job well-done in decorating and furnishing the place. It's really distinctive and luxurious. However, the rough plastic-feeling purple couches do not feel pleasant to the touch. They look like velvet, but are vinyl. Major fail on this! This requires immediate attention.

Patio: Great views and plenty of seating. However, hated how many stupid old smelly cigar smokers were out there clogging up the air. I'm not sure what can be done about these disgusting people, but overall the patio set up is one of the best around...",review,Uf-jZhhEYRIFxzyT1d5R6Q,0,1,0

Do you suppose they have problems with segregation/integration?  You know, the  tomatoes CLAIM that the bagels could have moved into the produce department if they had CHOSEN to; they just CHOSE to occupy shelf space in the bakery department because they LIKED being with their own kind?  Doesn't a bathroom cleaning product have the same rights to locate itself in a freezer case as a gelato does if that's what its little heart desires?  Do the canned yams believe that there is nothing wrong with the candy in the bulk food section, they just wouldn't want THEIR daughter to marry one?  I almost wanted to stick a carrot in the dairy section just to make the point.  NO MORE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL around here.  Nope, we're a modern day non-bigotted ""everybody deserves a fair shot around here"" kind of grocery store.

Well, I finally had the occasion to stop in here over the the weekend I was visiting Phoenix and was surprised to discover it catered to a mainly Hispanic customer base.  Being from Bakersfield, California, this made me feel at home at once!  There was mariachi music playing over the PA system, and there were spanish language entertainment magazines by the checkout.  

I stopped in because a friend texted me to pick up a bottle of Pinot Grigio for her.  Now, I know that those of you who shop here regularly are probably still rolling on the floor laughing, but remember - I'm from out of state and didn't know any better.  When I discovered their tiny wine section, and that it was mostly Carlo Rossi & Gallo wine, I was momentarily downcast.  But there, on the very top shelf, were a few varietals by a decent Australian Wine Cellar and - Lo and behold - one lonely Pinot Grigio.  Ta - da!  Cue cherubs descending Earthward blowing trumpets in celebration.  And to make it even more exciting IT WAS ON SALE!  Yes, normally priced at $7.99 a bottle, they were on sale for $5.99 each.  I decided to bring her two bottles just to celebrate.

The checker was very friendly and spoke English with only a minimal accent so bonus there, too.  The final kicker was when I gave my friend the receipt she discovered they'd only charged me $4.99 per bottle. Woohoo!

The store was very clean and I did notice they had an excellent selection of Hispanic themed items so if you're looking for that sort of thing, this place might be for you!",review,377CDhtGrgoNNEnEhf6Ccw,0,2,1

I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice.

This place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch, and you are on the go. Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and it's better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now).

They tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some.

Now my 18 fans are stuck with my incredibly less witty new review.

Believe it or not, I actually had not been to Sprinkles in well over a year.  Unbelievable, I know, considering I live close by.  Maybe that says something.  Something along the lines of I'm not really anxious to pay more for a single cupcake than it costs me to make a dozen or two at home.  But what do you do when it's August and the thought of adding any more heat to the kitchen just won't do, and yet you really need a cupcake?  Well, you go stand in a line 12 deep to pay $14 for 4 cupcakes.

I've been to Sprinkles maybe 4 times now, and they've been pretty consistent.  I do like their frosting, but I find the cake to be somewhat dry and flavorless IMO.  And I'm always surprised by the line here.  Are people that much in love with Sprinkles, or is it that most of the population is not able to read the directions on a Betty Crocker box?  I'm not saying Sprinkles is bad.  It certainly has its place in my life for a cupcake fix, particularly when I know if I make 12, I'll eat 12.  But I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a fan.

So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.

The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.

ENTREE

For starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.

I ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.

DESSERT

They have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.

AMBIANCE/SERVICE

The waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant.

They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.

There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.

There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.",review,U_fAIe7CUaGMejwSdNvMgw,1,0,1

We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was ""Kids Eat Free"" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....

The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  

So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  
Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!

Try the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!

This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!

The baklava isn't fabulous, but everything else is worthy of a special trip.  Once again, the chicken shawarma draws me in, though I'll occasionally force myself into breaking out of that far too predictable mold (for falafel since I truly am stuck in a rut).  The hummus is great.  As mentioned, the salads mainly consist of iceburg lettuce, but they are not stingy with the feta and the dressing is amazing.

There is night, semi-scrubby outdoor seating and the drinks are bottled or canned.  Last year I went with a group of friends for Valentine's Day and there was a musician who was slightly too loud for the environment.  When something special is going on, the owner comes around and checks with the patrons to verify quality and whether or not the activity is enjoyable.  This is always a nice classy touch for a little dive.

It's a rarer occasion that I find my way down there.  Let's be honest: I only go that direction for SMoCA, the Venue of Scottsdale, and EZ Tattoo.  It's not generally ""my scene"" and it's definitely out of my way.

Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.

I went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.

Rentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.

Bring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)

And yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)

They require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.

It's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!

We're on the lookout for more rivers to float on!",review,zTWH9b_ItSdLOK9ypeFOIw,6,9,4

My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. 

Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. 

Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. 

If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.",review,nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw,10,11,2

There is no indication next to the names of the yogurts what ingredients are in it, so I am docking a star for that. I'm trying to avoid eating eggs as much as I can and it is always helpful when that information is available without having to ask. I have been on the website enough times now to know which flavors have eggs and which don't so its not a problem for me anymore, but for anyone else it would be. But the flavors I have had have all been good. The fruity pebble flavor I had awhile ago actually tasted just like the cereal. It was a fun flavor. 

The topping bar is a good size. There are fruits, candies, and nuts among other toppings. My husband and I are generally happy with this topping bar. 

The best thing about this location is on Wednesdays, if you come in wearing pajamas (or something resembling pajamas) you get 50% off your total! Its a great deal.

We want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more
I want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

I want more
We need more
I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is

[Verse 2:]
Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground

It was raining men.  And I liked it. 
A few minutes after entering the bar, I knew exactly why I was surrounded by a sea of men- the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes. 
Let me clarify: they did have tiny skirts on, even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out, so I guess that constitutes as clothes.
The outfits were cute, but extremely revealing, so much so that even I had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and I know the guys around me were having the same problem.
The bartenders (all men) were all pretty cute. And wearing kilts.  All I kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work.
The food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive.  You'll find the usual apps, sandwiches, tons of salads, chicken fingers, wings and so on.

I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist, but I was pleasantly surprised this time.  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.  My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service. This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head, please give Vs a try.  By the way, it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra.",review,TLxb5zxzXO-Y0bFB__i53g,0,1,0

First time I came in here it was packed to this gills, and no where to sit so we left.. Next!

Second time I came here I met 2 of the strangest old women I've ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldn't shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldn't help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked.

I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper I've ever seen.

I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*",review,v5k-__wHo2xPI25WO-dcQA,4,5,7

I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.

So the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.

That was when they pulled out dessert.

I'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.

I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.

Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.

While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks.",review,lczLjHO7zIhrmSlOXI3ohg,1,1,1

Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.

When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.

I love this place and hope I always will.",review,5cVACUA-5e1SYyQ_E2-9iw,2,6,1

It was served with iceberg, roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries, ""Kilo Fries."" The fries were seasoned with a cheese blend, which seemed a little dry to me. However, a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit. The tea was delicate and refreshing - a nice complement to my lunch selection.

I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche.

I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, ""well we don't have anymore of that one.""

Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. 

Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. 

Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.

Now I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. 

Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.

Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.

Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.",review,7o6OfRHsmcv44R1CjAh8dQ,0,2,0

Yes, it's a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service.

Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too.

I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :)

The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them.

The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and it's a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldn't order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... I'd order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :)

So I went where my friend goes and I was pleasantly surprised. Not to be snobby but I have done the strip mall walk in nail salon and usually walk out disappointed. I was expecting the absolute worst to be honest. 

The girl who worked on me NAILED IT! Pun totally intended.

I got the gel because that is all they offer. I normally get Shellac but hey...I am a convert for now. I will let you know how the hold up over time. For now my nails are amazing. Not only do they look great but it was done in half the normal time. 

The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5. 

The place is a little on the not so new or super clean side. It's not dirty it's just not 5 stars. They also do not provide you with the nail oil my regular nail lady gives me to keep my nails hydrated. The only other thing is the lack of color selection for gels. If you are feeling like you need that electric blue, neon yellow or emerald green (color of 2013) then you are out of luck.

First off,  I ordered the Italian sub that comes with the works (5 different meats) and is supposed to come with provolone.  Got home to Buckeye to learn there was no provolone on my sandwich.  That throws the taste of an Italian sub off, period.  My second disappointment was the meat.  The franchise contracts out to a provisioner to make all their cold cuts under the Jersey Mike's label, but the meat does not have the flavor of New Jersey's finest deli meats, Thumann's. Boar's Head doesn't come in close to Thumann's but I'll take Boar's Head when nothing else is available. Third place goes to Dietz and Watson.  If Peter Cancro, the CEO of Mike's really cares, he'll get his meat elsewhere. 

The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean, there were blown up photos of the Pt. Pleasant side of the Manasquan Inlet and Jenk's pier with surfers heading out, a nice touch of back home, but that's the best I can say.

You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)

Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!

For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said ""we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it""....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!

Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.

There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.

I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.

The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.

Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.

The Food:

* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.
* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.
* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good
* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.
* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.
* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.

The grounds are kept clean and tidy, except for some irresponsible pet owners. Some of them even let their pets run around leash-less or cannot control them. But that is not the management's issue.

Pros:
1. The apts are spacious, well-built.
2. Grounds are clean and grass is maintained.
3. Pool is well-maintained.
4. Online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great.
5. Price is great for the value.

Cons:
1. Apts not sound-proof or heat-proof.
2. Sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area.
3. Covered parking is extra $$$ and not enough of them anyways.
4. Uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back.
5. Security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides.
6. Outer compound Walls are not high enough to actually prevent/make it difficult for an intruder.
7. Fitness center is adequate at best. Most of the free weights and equipment (except the machines) are broken or missing. The machines work ok, but are not maintained well.

bRk44ShCT0osos-1xaTRyA,2008-09-21,eYtmkXM7xLwb0w-OpAqIIQ,5,"I love me some Dobson Ranch.  As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned, this is as good as it gets (Aguila is a close second).  No overbearing marshalls.  Rates that top out at $28 in the winter.  Above average range and practice area, including two large putting greens.  Cheap pitchers of beer.  A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!  

As far as the course itself, this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti, only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.    But there are birdies to be had, and lots of them; #1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda, not some hybrid or bent grass, so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.  #5 is my favorite hole, a short-par 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway, leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.  #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice, as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time, as your ball will face a watery grave.  #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.  And finally, #18, a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length), there are some low scores out there.

A great course, value, practice area, and recently renovated restaurant and bar - 5 stars.",review,dQO0tQISZyb9L4d5ASnXyQ,0,1,0

The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal.

After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.

In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.

The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars.

Short Review:

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review:
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. 

The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. 

The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!

The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""?? 

The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!

If any of this appeals to you this is your place!

Kau5iJl6VR-TJ20YGrL7MQ,2009-02-07,tB1RGzfF-wpGSA_6pXH88A,2,"I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)

But. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.

Pull in and i tell the guy i want the ""Signature"" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy. 

i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).

I get pulled into the garage area for the ""spiel"" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker ""Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?"" the other guy says ""the jeep."" however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.

OK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)

the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.

W7xb2iS4cYL14Yi5LOGSkA,2012-07-20,mYQUMTcBhBp_NTaj7gQr8Q,1,"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.",review,YnuPa08WRFw_VYQsb3rcoA,0,2,0
WSHQ9qpL39g5xA3E5iBCmw,2011-10-09,HwZKlZ4F3RH3adez4cC4FA,5,"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.

The Service
My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.

The Food
We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.
For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.
Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.
After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  

Atmosphere
We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.",review,fiyOnIEKBOgj00NJLwDBVg,7,7,8

I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.

Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:

Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado!
Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50
Udon - Good!

Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up.
Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also.
Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt.
Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho.
Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have ""Yasu style"" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top.
Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!

The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).

Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  

Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars.",review,dQO0tQISZyb9L4d5ASnXyQ,0,0,0

Daytime:
The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the ""worst and trashiest"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.

Nighttime:
Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.

Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.

This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.
There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.
I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.

Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.
The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a ""specialty store"" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.

On to the ""restaurant"" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.

Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.
I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad.
Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.
Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too.

I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers.

My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.

We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!

It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!

We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.

This place reminded us a bit of a great small pancake house in Anaheim, CA called the Original Pancake House. It is much bigger and modern, so it lacks charm, but the food is better than standard faire. With that said, the creativity is good in their menu selection, but poorly executed. I had the banana french toast and was a bit disappointed. The banana bread used was fine, but too dense for french toast. It hardly had any egg coating to truly classify it as french toast. 

They serve huge slices of raisin toast, but bigger is not necessarily better. Very dry and not flavorful. 

Eggs were fine, and the service was good. I would come here before going to IHOP, but I would seek a different small hole in the wall breakfast joint before rushing back here.

Add ""beefy"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!

After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!

And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!

I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.

The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).

The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. 

The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of ""look at me"" crap on the walls (""Best Fries in Hoboken!"")

The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...""I come from a land down under""...I shuddered a little bit at the part ""and men chunder""...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).

Anyway...

I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).

I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!

I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.

But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you ""accidentally"" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!)

 And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars.",review,du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g,10,10,11

Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area.

We had a 3rd floor garden view, which was very Zen with a natural pond and fountain, and access to their Regency Club (a must have). The spa was very nice and they carry high quality products. They also have so many options to hang by a pool, including a private spa mineral pool (sans children). We understand there is a great kids pool also. The food was delicious at their restaurant also.

We did not experience any construction issues (as they may be finished), but we certainly benefited from all their efforts. It is beautifully appointed and plenty of spaces that feel private. It is not a convention-like hotel, but I have heard (from a corporate event planner) they do a wonderful job for large parties. 

Everyone from the valet, to registration, housekeeping and wait staff were more than accommodating and very friendly.

So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.

The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.

While in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and ""deliciousness"") of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary, it wouldn't rank at all.

You really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though.  If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get.  

It can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan.  

Also, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill.

The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?

The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor.
***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!

The Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.

The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).  

A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)

This place is really quite strange. Video coffee bar? I don't have much to compare it to, I guess.

We'll start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor.

Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) 

The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the '90s. Very strange, in my opinion. I'm not sure that Cher and Madonna really mesh with coffee shop, but I guess they're trying something new.

Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back.

Situated in what seems to be a motel from the outside and a garage on the inside, Cartel can satiate your brass tax coffee fix and your espresso lust for reasonable prices.  

The coffee is great.  Period.  They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud.  The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty.  The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one.  The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type.  The vibe can come off a little pretentious sometimes with all their rules and such, but they are selling a great product and the rules help distinguish them from the crowd.

NleiJA9dpfKjhxe0cCD1MA,2008-04-17,7tg3X6RPdDYiyracX4YIuw,1,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:

The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.

We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.

20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.

It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...

By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home.

I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in...

I prefer Terminal 4 because of the variety of eating/drinking options for pre-flight enjoyment, and 2 and 3 are just OK and don't offer so much in amenities... but they're less crowded and that is a nice plus.  Also, free wifi!

I rarely get lost in here and to be honest, security here has never been an issue... lines have been long going to gates in Term 4 but they move fairly quickly.

I don't do body-scans (my personal choice), so if you choose to do the same, when you put your crap in the conveyor belt and you note they are only doing body scanners, alert the TSA person and let them know you'll need a pat-down (or a groping.. feel-up.... whatever you wanna call it ;)).  Electing to do this takes me longer to get through security, but I prefer it and plan ahead.

Also, if you have a digital boarding pass on your iPhone or Android and go through a *different* gate (they are mostly all connected via runways, etc) due to the line at the gate you're supposed to go through, note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass... this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line.. luckily they had the kiosk just there so I ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot.

I've attended 2 events there and its basically a disaster in trying to make your way through the 200-300 patrons they bring in.

Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). 

Lines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good.

Pho Avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so I end up going to this place. It also helps that LeeLee Supermarket is one street over so I get a Viet fix and my Asian needs shopping in one trip. The pho and com tam is average. The service is fast and friendly enough. I do find it a big stingy that they don't bring out the bowl of broth/soup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it.

We we're okay with this but our server spoke to the manager without us even complaining or asking him to and honored the 9p happy hour because of the Yelp listing. 

Now to the food and drink. 
If you love cheese, their cheese menu was very large. We got several of the cheeses, the Tres Freres was my favorite (non-happy hour item though). The pork empanadas are a must and the happy hour drinks were very good as well. The strawberry sunset martini was very yummy. 

I'd say the happy hour items are where it's at overall. The food was great the drinks were good. Really given their menu and atmosphere I was really surprised that it wasn't more busy.

1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!

Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...

Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.

#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar

Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.


# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal

Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.

Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.


# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami

Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.

Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  


Coconut Ice Cream: Yum

Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.

Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.

I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.  

Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV

A few weeks back my boyfriend and I wanted to get a little buzzed at home, so we decided on streets of new york to deliver us some grub. We went with pasta. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with meat balls, and I got the meat ravioli. Ah I really hate to say this, but I would have had a better time eating a can of Chef Boyardee. I don't know what is up with their ""beef/sausage"" but it always has a funny taste to it. Kind of like when you re-heat a hamburger in the microwave. That taste. I was less than impressed. The salad it came with was decent, and I'd go back just for the bread, but even with a buzz I wasn't enjoying my pasta. The boyfriend agreed it lacked flavor and was 'off'. 

Then yesterday we decided to have another one of these nights, and do the Pizza instead since our pizza was good the first round. I got chicken and pepperoni on mine, and he got sausage. They charge extra for chicken. Um.. I don't really understand why. The chicken is breaded chicken strips that they just cut up and threw on the pizza. I wasn't impressed AT all. The sausage on my boyfriends pizza tasted weird and sweet like.... I don't know what's up with this place!

A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  

Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says ""Lunch Specials"" and where it says ""Sandwiches.""  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  

Instead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  

My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  

All in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.  

My husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for.",review,vUM21g3cPEdSlI89oDttgw,0,1,0

OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?)

I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting.

Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!

I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice. 

The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered. 

My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff. 

I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved. 

Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong. 

The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours. 

I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.

The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either. 

To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that ""the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished"". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.

This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered.

The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still.

My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.

If they showed new independent movies for $10 and old movies for $5 I think they would really have something cool going on. I hope they can figure it out because I'd really like to see the place become what it could be.",review,Pv7DGHzZ-uqIUdOsqPpsVg,0,1,0

Lost a star because they are a tad bit overpriced.

Haven't received anything yet. Now I know that the turnaround time on cards is between 12-14 days, but I didn't receive any confirmation that they'd been shipped, or what method they were being shipped through. Luckily I was able to call them and talk to people who straightened everything out, but I really get a strong feeling that they're a very small company that's still trying to learn the ropes.

The biggest problem I had was that my shipping and billing addresses are different. There's a box where you type in your shipping address, then it takes you to the billing section. When I got my order confirmation, I noticed that my billing address and shipping address were listed as the same at the top of the order, then lower down in the order section was where I had typed in my correct shipping address, yet it was partially cut off. I called them about it and they assured me that it was shipping to the correct address, however once I called UPS and had them reassure me that my cards were coming to the correct address, I received another email from Taste saying that the reason my samples weren't delivered was because I didn't give them the correct address. I looked back at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was typed into the bottom of my order. It was a matter of not paying attention I guess.

Suggestions would be to either pay closer attention to their customers entire order, or to work on the billing/shipping page instead of leaving it as a box to type words in, especially if it's not going to be read.

Pros are that they get back to you very quickly and make sure that your custom order is correct for print.
Cons seem to be the shipping and customer care portion.

That means, sure, I'd go back and I should state here and now that the 3 stars might not be all their fault but my fault too.

Plan to see mid-week movie with my daughter who teaches at junior high school and after school volleyball and we have plans for 7:45 movie which means time is compressed. Daughter has limited sense of adventure for foods so I figure this place always offers her bail-out choice of Italian. Enough background...

Problem is, I had lunch too late and I arrived less than hungry. I'm equivocal what to order. I ask waiter for advice (mistake). I order cream soda and he comes back and asks me what flavor and listing too many choices. I order cherry and it seems to be a club soda with grenadiene (sp?) - mistake.

Orders arrive - daughter shocks me by ordering Pad Thai which was quite good. I get winter special of Ishikari - Salmon, cabbage, tofu and rice noodles rather cleverly cooked in a miso based soup in industrial type mini-bucket with oak sealing lid and apparently brought to table from oven. The salmon infusion into the miso was an incredibly delightful broth. The salmon appeared to be generous, good quality but a bit undercooked and I didn't have the time window to do anything about it. The rest...the tofu / cabbage / etc. seemed to derive no benefit from the delightful miso broth.

So in the end...I probably could have given them 4 stars because there is nothing inherently wrong with CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe. The waiter wasn't all that helpful but he was available at the most important times and we managed to get orders, served and check paid in time for movie which by other reviews worried me because of our narrow time window and the fact that this place is indeed busy.

My curiosity finally got to me, so my boyfriend and I went in to try the food.  We waited quite a few minutes (easily 10 to 15) for our order, which is a good sign for fresh preparations.  The joint is hooked up with a juke box, pool table, dining area with tables and chairs, and two benches near the register, for those waiting to take their food home.  There were special desserts in a glass display cabinet, including coconut clusters and sweets I've seen in Mexico.  The assortment of beverages is outstanding, offering both Coke and Pepsi products, juices, CapriSun, horchata, beer, and Sunny Delight!  The menu is about par for Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, in terms of content and price.  I got a fish taco, which was outstanding!  No cheap tartar sauce here!  I also got a cheese quesadilla, which came garnished with lettuce and tomato slices.  The quesadilla was warm and fresh, on an obviously fresh tortilla filled with tasty cheese.  For the two of us to eat a few a la carte items from the menu, the total came to $11.00.  There are also combination plates available, as well as quite a few soups.  Overall, I was very impressed!

They don't have those things here, so I settled for the nearest looking sandwich, a ""Mexican Torta"".  (My server did say the ownership is the same as the Sunnyslope location.)  Anyhow, here's how it was for me here today:

*  This is a good sized place, & I managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at, even though they were ROARING BUSY!

*  My nice server almost immediately brought me a big basket of tortilla chips & two kinds of salsa, medium & hot!  Both were good.  (They don't even serve tortilla chips at Sunnyslope.)

*  I ordered, & it took a little while for my sandwich to arrive, but as I said, they were super busy!  No problemo.  Meanwhile, I ate about half of my chips, & Señorita brought me ANOTHER big basket of them, & more salsa!

*  My torta arrived, & it was BIG & DELICIOUS!  It comes with a side salad, which included some pimento & cucumber slices, lime halves, lettuce, & a fried quarter onion.  All this was good too (&  DID remind me of the other location).

*  Gripes?  THREE TVs blabbing out a show in Spanish, fairly loud, & this place was noisy to begin with.

SO?  ...I didn't care as much for the menu here as Sunnyslope, & the TVs were a bit of a nuisance, but with that said, I still think this is an very good place to eat, & the value was AMAZING at only $6.50 for everything!     :-))",review,ikm0UCahtK34LbLCEw4YTw,3,4,2

The word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times, and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach 1 out of there, sonic boom be damned. I understand it from a  marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores I suppose. Do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing? Has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions?  I am also aware that we eat with our eyes, have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc. However, I firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies, legumes, tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel, the end result would be much better. For Example the Mexicali burger, no mock meat reference here. How about listing something as ""whatever the hell it is"" served Parmesan style? 
 
I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was in the area. Cool space, it was open colorful and inviting. A couple of organs line a small space up front. Nice mild funk flavor to the decor. Ordering is done counter style and they bring it out to you. You pretty much go behind the counter to get ice for your beverage which I thought was a bit of a weird queue. 

I ordered the spicy Thai peanut, a dish that offered mock choices, but I went with the crispy tofu. The brown rice that was the bedding here was ok, lukewarm at best. the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever.The tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned, which really dumbfounded me. I think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just off. Copious amounts of cock sauce, err... Sriracha saved it from blandsville.

Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!

We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking. 

Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.",review,zjX3Bph1uSWtrhaLCuyC2g,0,1,0

Anyway, I NEVER eat pasta because I ""try"" to stay away from those carbs, so even coming here was a giant step for me.  I wasn't expecting the pasta here to be anything great but boy was I wrong.  Each one that I tried was excellent.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious and each was very flavorful.  I don't remember exactly which ones I tried (I tried 4 of them), but each one was excellent.  They probably don't make a bad pasta dish.

Some of the dishes have some odd/random ingredients, but don't let that scare you.  Order each dish as it is listed on the menu and you won't be disappointed. 

When I feel like I have to get carbed up for a big race I will return!

If it's not on your neck it's not accidental,

Anyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a ""Jesus toast"" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.

So when I told my waiter I was having a ""bad toast experience"" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the ""toast"" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal"".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?

Ok, now all the anger is stirred up... I must say that My florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rate-amazing.  She truly plays from her soul and her personality shines through in her interpretations of classic songs.

I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but ""butterburger"" and ""frozen yogurt"" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.
Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.
The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8"" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the ""value basket"" deal.
Their frozen yogurt or ""concrete mix"" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their ""brownie cookie dough"".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum! 
Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it).   I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating.",review,TVMLSvdYuHK3BOwh-kafRQ,0,1,1

Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. 

The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. 

Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. 

Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!",review,2nXFEyQ06RfcdAXIPbxuwA,0,0,0

In a fit of random adventurousness, I thought it would be fun to try a new kind of food for me.  I'm typically a weenie and afraid of anything ""weird"" so this is a big deal for me.  We drove out here on Friday night and at around 6 or so the restaurant was about half full.  We stood at the door for entirely too long while we waited to be seated.  When we were at our table, we waited entirely too long to get menus.  When we knew what we wanted, we waited entirely too long to place our order.  You get the idea.  Thankfully the food came out fairly quickly.  

I ordered the vegetarian plate that had collard greens, some kind of cabbage/carrot/potato thing, red lentils, and some bean/carrot/onion thing.  As with all dishes, it was served with the injera, a weird sourdough crepe thing.  I was a little weirded out that the bread thing was served cold, but I got used to it quickly enough.  Everything on my plate was yummy, but if I were to rank it, my favorite would be the lentils, followed by the collard greens, then the potato, then the carrot/bean thing.  

Eating here was a fun experience for sure, and not having any silverware definitely made for some creative feeding procedures.  I would probably come back here if the mood for Ethiopian food struck me again, but I would really hope that the service would be better.  Since everyone else mentions great service, I am going to assume we came at an ""off"" time.",review,W_QXYA7A0IhMrvbckz7eVg,0,0,0

I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.

When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.

Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.

The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre.",review,2sM4fCVg6FNdfq3FLDJbIw,1,5,6

pgz6IeaZgLuzqrk6HMPhzA,2010-02-28,F21FB1A_XHfpvSdZPRo2Ng,5,"The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.

What's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.

One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.  

The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.  

What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.  

If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.",review,mQ6LzbfhBbLA5HUTKDVYfg,1,1,0

""You've never been to Chino Bandido?""
""No, what is it?""
""How long have you lived here?""
""About eleven years, but a bunch of those years were when I was a toddler, and I just moved back from a few years in Flagstaff.""
""And you've never been to Chino?""
""NO. What is it?""
""Amazing.""
""Take me there.""
""Okay.""

Yet we never went.

On the drive home from the Children's Museum of Phoenix, I realized that I was hungry, on a budget, and Chino Bandido was not too far off of path.  I ran the plan by my father, checking to make sure that would be an appropriate Father's Day dinner.  I received a confused look and thumbs up.  He's not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences, but is generally a good sport.

If my friend and I had been on the ball, I could have been eating here for four years.  Granted, I rarely have business around 19th and Greenway, but I could have made Chino Bandido my business.

We both ate a perfectly reasonably sized and delicious dinner for less than $10.  Three cheers for Caribbean influenced burritos and homemade teriyaki sauce.

Stevey P mentioned the only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars: If the dining room weren't so disgusting that I had trouble eating in it, it would easily be a five star place.

Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. 
I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings.

Another appetizer was a date wrapped in bacon - this was super delicious and easy to eat. I ordered a pineapple mojito and at first our server was confused, saying they don't have a blender but could make us a raspberry mojito. (I've had bartenders tell me they don't have blenders when I've ordered mojitos before, so I was used to this.) Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake came in a cute mason jar and was amazing. I really liked my chocolate cake but the cheesecake was better. For once everything the husband ordered was better than what I had ordered!

Then people say ""Oh I don't like IPA's"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.

The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

So, instead of coming home with two, which was the plan, I got one for cheap. I didn't want one for cheap. I wanted two. 

The food itself is typical. The crust, cheese and toppings are average, sloppy in a bad way. The sauce is a bit to sweet for my liking, but having eaten here twice, has tasted different each time. The service was alright, delivery took about an hour on a Friday.

iJPG0GPcIirjOMlmzZWxBQ,2008-07-14,IDFpYyXoCUVLvdIv7Wi1mA,4,"I live in a town where I can find 5 Filipino restaurants in a 5 mile radius. So when I came to Phoenix for work, I wanted to see what the Filipino restaurant scene was like.

Like the previous reviewer stated, there are very few Filipino eateries. The supermarket that I found on my GPS was closed, so I found this one on Yelp. Overall, I would recommend to go to support the local Filipino restaurant.

When you first walk in, you start in the bake shop area where you'll find cakes and pastries on display. I wasn't sure if I could seat myself, but I was greeted and seated. There were two other tables filled with about 8 people eating including myself. What concerned me is that 2 of the other folks were the only other Filipinos - as I tend to judge all ethnic restaurants by the number of people of the same ethnicity.

But that logic doesn't seem to work here were the demographics of Filipinos seems relatively low.

I was craving Sisig (grilled pork - which is my favorite at Ongpin in South San Francisco) - but they didn't have that. On the whiteboard, they had Sinigang na Baboy (pork) - so I figured I couldn't go wrong with one of my favorites.

Since I was here on business, I figured I'll order a few other things including the shanghai lumpia (eggrolls), Halo Halo, and topped it off with Hot Pandesal.

The Sinigang was served in a bowl with 3 pieces of boneless pork. The meat was very tender and you can pull it apart with a spoon and fork. The soup was a little on the salty side since they may have put a little more tamarind mix, but that I might just be a little oversensitive about my sodium intake.

I couldn't help but think that I was eating at home or a family friend's house. Included in the sinigang was spinach, string beans, eggplant, a small potato, and cut onions. What was missing was dikons (those white radish things). It wasn't bad, and it wasn't exceptionally delicious because nothing compares to home made sinigang. But this would be the next best thing. I ate all the meat, and had quite a few eggplants left.

The shanghai lumpia came out shortly afterwards. The portion was pretty large and I could have shared it with someone else. I didn't care for sauce that it came with. I wanted vinigar, but a filipino family came in and there was only one server.

If you ever had Halo Halo at Ongpin, you'd find this lacking. It is served it a large plastic cup. What was missing is the ube ice cream. In fact, there was hardly any ube in it. There was a spoonfull of the leche flan, but I didn't finish it.

I actually ordered the Pandesal later, this version was like two very large dinner rolls served with butter. The bread had a fresh out of the oven taste.

The restaurant section was clean, with standard fare dining. There was a large flatscreen tv with TFC playing.

Last week, when I ate there, they were just written about in the local paper, but I didn't get to read the review.

They accept Master Card and Visa, but not American express.

I would eat here again to try some of their other dishes not because I want to support my fellow Filipinos, but because the food is actually worth having again. I took some photos of each dish with my iPhone, so I'll have to figure out how to upload them.

Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.

My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.

She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.

Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  

This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.

And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.

I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.

During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.

These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.

Walked here with friends and the name had changed. The wait staff saw my confusion and quickly reassured me that the name and menu had slightly changed but the food was basically the same. I had the curry fish last time and was craving it so I tried it again and yes, still absolutely delicious. Tried the calamari and crab wontons as appetizers. The calamri was solid but the crab wontons were only okay. A little too fried and in a skin that didn't feel like wonton skin. The curries that came to our table looked pretty neutral colored and the noodle dishes, instead of being on the red side or the dark brown side was also very neutral colored. Since I didn't taste those dishes, I can't legitimately penalize the restaurant but I have to admit that I hesitate to order anything else besides the fish because of their appearance. I'm still going to give this place 4 stars because of the taste of the food I ordered, the good service and the fact they had brown rice as an option. If ever I'm brave enough to stray off the path, my rating may change. But in the meantime, check this place out and order the curry fish on their specialties menu.

As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.
 
Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    
 
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.
 
Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!
 
So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy.

Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.  

We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.

The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.

My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.

I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.

One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.

Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.
.  
To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.

The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.

I showed up today (Sunday) and was a little thrown off by all the people at the bag drop wearing football jerseys. Especially when the people wearing jerseys were the ones grabbing my clubs and putting them in a cart. Thought I was at Buffalo Wild Wings! 

I thought this was a very nice course but the reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it just didn't have that top notch feel that other Troon managed properties have. The greens were very inconsistent; some really fast, some really slow, and some were bumpy. The grass on gold was extremely long and it was very easy to lose your ball in the rough because the grass was so deep. Blue was cut much better but I had a couple complaints with holes 7 and 9. If you're playing the blue course in the late afternoon, you might as well close your eyes while teeing off at 7 and 9 because the architect made the course so you look directly into the sun. 

I sneaked on today for $44 bucks and was very satisfied with what I got for the price. If I didn't live 15 miles away, and could always get on for $40 I'd probably golf here a lot more. If the green fees are above $50, I just couldn't justify it with all the other nice options around the valley.

But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth.

The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone.

The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..

We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.

We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. 

For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...

The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!",review,q9XgOylNsSbqZqF_SO3-OQ,7,8,3

What a fun and comfortable experience.  We walked in and were greeted right away.  We had made reservations but there was absolutely no reason to.  It was a Monday night and really @ 7:30 there wasn't a whole lot going on.  

Alec was our server.  We opted to sit in the bar area.  Same menu available.  We started off with the Haas Guac and the Green Chile Stew.  We initially made the mistake thinking that the stew was going to be like the kind @ Roaring Fork.  It's not.  They would do themselves a favor if they called it hash.  I suppose hash is not as appealing as stew.  Nonetheless it was good.  The little fry breads that they give were not my favorite but it was good with the chips that came with the guac.  I had the pork tenderloin and hubs had the mac and cheese with chicken.  Both good.  Really good.  

It would have been a five star review but there was something weird tasting in my diet coke.  Like soap or something.  Hubby thought maybe it was because they probably didn't sell a whole lot of soda product. I dunno.  Could have been the straw, the glass, syrup ratio to C02.

They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say.

They do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing. All of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar. They use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read. It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-5 be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice.

It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities.

Their service is great! You will be greeted from the time that you step a foot through their door. Unfortunately, per today's so-called standards this is not a very common courtesy. 

If you a first time customer or a returning customer, you can ask the person behind a counter to recommend a meal for you or you can ask for a minute or five. As a very indecisive person when it comes to choosing an item from a menu... I really, REALLY appreciate it when I do not feel rushed when it comes to making such an important decision in my overwhelmed life. :P

Lunch is served with your choice of the sides... Oh, and did I mentioned that their prices are extremely affordable! $5-$13 price range!!

On my most recent visit, I called ahead to pick up my family's order and we were not disappointed, once again.  We ordered a variety of menu items (and in typical 'When Harry Met Sally...' style) - a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich (subbing the goat cheese for American & changing the multigrain bun to egg), a build-your-own burger with an egg bun, spicy chipotle mayo, pickles and onions, an order of Smashfries, an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles.  Everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces (ranch, etc;) were provided without having to ask.  
On weekends, this shop is jam packed and it's a wait to get a table, but worth it.  During the week, everything flows very smoothly and the vultures ""circling"" for booths is at a minimum.

Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups.

The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic.

mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,2010-09-11,LDEj_-lmUw9ug-AQxgitQA,5,"I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. 

When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new ""parents"" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. 

To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. 

While I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? 

This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.",review,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ,8,12,3

It's about a 2600' climb in elevation, so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks. You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks. I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.

My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.  Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.

Honestly, I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, ""fresh jalapenos!"") and the great selection of sodas.

The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.

I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.

Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table.

Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.

3 tips:

-Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.

-Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker ""Little Cheeseburger"" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the ""Little"" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings.

-Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and ""POOF!"", you'll get it!

Enjoy!

The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.

Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. 
Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. 

Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger. If thats not a sign, when customers have to get creative on how to eat at your place without breaking the bank, take a good hard look at how you might make your customers more happy.

Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, it's already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but it's hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer...

Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. 

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. 

My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.

The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.

That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos. I'm pretty picky about my tacos. I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos.

That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two.

Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  

We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.

The space was child friendly - nice menu although they didn't offer crayons to kids, which they said they were in the process of incorporating.  

Menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations. I had the waffle with eggs and sausage. I ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children. It is prepared with sausage that was fantastic. The perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good. My waffle was wonderful.  Really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  My friend ordered the French Toast, which was coated in captain crunch cereal (this sounds odd, but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness) and served with her choice of bacon. She ordered the applewood smoked bacon. It was excellent. They have five different types of bacon, including one infused with jalapeno, which I will try next time. 

The service was a bit slow, but understandable given it was the first week of opening.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot!",review,bl6qTJt0UkFoHtLIm2PdPQ,0,1,0

The building is a trip -  the outside looks like a doublewide trailer on a foundation, but the inside has a homey Northeastern Mexico look. On the other hand, even though the guacamole was fresh, it's a little bright and lacks strong taste, and the red hot sauce is too watery(it's still got that kick). Overall, if you're not itchin over substandard guacamole and marginally inflated prices for the location then it's a great place to chow.

ke3RFq3mHEAoJE_kkRNhiQ,2012-08-04,T70lUpub5MgNq6Ap-iulRA,1,"Bad experience...Terrible service, terrible food.

First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.

Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  

And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.

So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.",review,-ZVmHZcdn_OH52QWwSMimA,0,1,0

I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago, and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst it's neighbors in the strip mall.

We started with the brochette, and spent the next 10 minutes raving about how amazing it was.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.  The meatballs were everything I was craving...a little spicy and filled with flavor.  My portion left enough for leftovers, but Brent ate his entire meal.  We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon.

I have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons:

1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere!

2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The bread is delicious, but the prepackaged butter that accompanied it didn't impress me.  I also would have liked freshly ground Parmesan on my spaghetti.

We noticed a lot of pizzas being picked up for takeout, and both thought the bar looked like a cute little place to come have a drink and a bite sometime.

PoRYjYUSjmeWM1WLsx_45w,2007-10-23,6b5sifuzXWw0cMd_8c9how,3,"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.",review,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA,4,5,4

The espresso was perfect and did not require any sweetener. I also got a blueberry muffin which wasn't very good, perhaps it was low fat or something but I am very picky about pastries anyway. 

My biggest problem with this place is the fact that they do not have a bathroom. Coffee makes me have to pee and when I discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasn't open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended, it was a bit undesirable. I know it's a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drink/food place. It does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention.

Our server was quite attentive without being intrusive. Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal.

The food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day.

Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito."" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.

I know, I know, there are probably many more places in AZ that sells these, but I honestly don't know of any other places that sell these other than Mekong Plaza (here) and Lee Lee's in Chandler. 

It's around $1.30-1.40 a bun and they seem very fresh because the times that I've came by, someone is preparing and cooking them in large ovens in the back. Very nice that it is located by the Asian market and shops. They have a frequent buyer card you can pick up in the front (for every $100 you spend, you get $10 off your next bakery purchase). This is gonna be in use for me since I can see myself coming back countless times!!

Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there. Price is very reasonable. And drinks selection, if not overly excessive, is ""Cool"".  Place is not riddled with kids, like many other places are, and you can actually kick back and have a conversation there.
One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2! This really makes a huge difference. 

I gave this place 4 starts. This is pretty much as high as it goes for me for this.

The dual menus, one french-ish and one southwestern-ish are sort of on odd pair, but it is Scottsdale. The appetizer, shrimp ""beinets"" were simply breaded, fried and very greasy while the lavender dipping sauce and salad that came along with were much more appealing. Both our entrees were wonderful and perfectly cooked - so well in fact, the sides were essentially meaningless, even though I remember them as fairly good also. So if you find yourself here, keep the Ahi Tuna and the Wild Boar in mind.  The wine menu is extensive and filled with surprises. 

The wait staff were classic in service, yet easily engaged in conversation and very friendly. They only acted snobby for the people who expected it, we on the other hand provided the Diamondbacks/Rockies scores and had a great time! We ended the night with great Grand Marnier birthday souffles.

Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need ""personality"" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.

As for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.

The peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.

The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. 

As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. 

The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.

Here's my old review for reference: 

Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.

It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.

It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though.",review,Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg,4,3,0

Second, I decided to give them a try for an early Friday dinner, about 5 in the evening. There were a few people dining in the restaurant, and quite a few people on staff for the evening. The dining room is pretty well decorated, more so than I thought it would be, giving a faux Hawaiian feel to it. Seeing some people there at that time gave me hope for a good meal.

I asked the lady manning the counter what was good, and she took a bit of time to walk me through the menu. Emphasizing the plate lunches, I decided to try the Combo that would get me the most variety. I elected for terriyaki beef and kalua pork. I took the side of the 'potato mac' and got my meal to go.

Arriving home, my meal sat for about 5 minutes before I had it unboxed and ready to enjoy. Considering that fact, everything was in pretty good condition. The potato mac was a bit more room temperature than cold, but that was my own doing. The rice stayed warm, the pork moist and really flavorful, and the beef sweet and tender.

Having dined at a few places offering plate lunches in the past, the potato mac was probably what sold me as much as the meats on why I'll return. Potato mac's tend to have a pretty flat flavor, and when I find out how Hawaiian's garnish them, I will be excited to get some more flavor in them. But it was just the right amount of dry ... I've had many potato mac's that are just too wet, but this felt about perfect.

-The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.

HEI4WFai9zoixD5GhCnbeg,2012-07-09,8TBgbLGmeS0OLkmohx4pIA,3,"Read all the reviews on Yelp and thought I give Chang's Chinese Buffet a try. With a 4 star rating, I was expecting 4 star quality food. Well, some of it was good, but some of it could be better. First of all the atmosphere was pretty nice. It almost felt like Cheers, where everyone knew your name. Even though we didn't know anyone there, everyone talked to one another. The T.V. in the corner drew most everyone's attention. You could tell who the regulars were. They were up front and closest to the T.V. 

Most of the food was fresh. The Shrimp was very fresh and tasty. The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food, it just wasn't brown. Orange chicken was good, but a little hard. Not as moist and juicing like I wanted. The chicken was dry. It was flavors well, but was dry inside. Seems like it was under the heating lamp too long. The sweet & sour soup was good, but I've tasted much better. The egg drop soup wasn't too good though. Spare ribs weren't bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didn't taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasn't bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, it's probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better.",review,Ts6UNH4LQp4YIwATf-cqnw,1,1,0

So it makes perfect sense that if the UWW Returns, so do I.  Well, return to Maizie's that is!  We started there this time and enjoyed all three wines they were tasting.  Their pizza and bruschetta bites were great.  And after we quickly inhaled the samples, we decided to get more food.  

The menu is pretty huge and everything sounded and looked delicious.  Yes, we were eyeing everybody else's plate as well; the bar seats are good for that!  After ooh-ing and ah-ing over what we saw, we decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip that came with chips and pit bread.  It was great!

The best part about Maizie's is that they just seem to do things right.  Friendly, casual service so you feel like you're among friends.  All sorts of specials listed up on the boards so 1) you don't have to feel dumb asking and 2) you don't have to feel even dumber when you forget and have to ask again.  Beer of the month (always fun to try), 20% off beer or wine to-go (what is this, Vegas?), happy hour specials (you had me at ""daily""), the list goes on and on.

I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection? Or maybe it's the added cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-check out lanes. Do I really have to stand in line for ten minutes behind a suburbanite with 2.5 screaming childes just to buy a couple sticks of buttah?

The service was kinda slow.

One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff. 
So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive. 
It seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff.

The fun is getting to assemble your own tacos. I ate nearly every bite and was stuffed for most of the day. 

My companions enjoyed the Reuben sandwich (layered corned beef on crispy rye, served with skinny fries that don't need ketchup) and the Halibut served on potato cake with spinach and carrot salad. Grandma-in-law said the halibut was tender and flavorful. I can imagine a bunch of friends or foodies mingling and laughing, sipping wine in relaxed delight as you drink in the beautiful view.

A few tips:
1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want. 
2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious.
3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.

There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.",review,nSLrExcVVphiNzvSf5H7vA,1,3,1

The interior is modern, spacious and very comfortable. The design is not only admirable, but also very broad. Inside the restaurant there are various types of seating. Tables, counters even plush chairs to chill and kick it with a glass of beer or wine among friends. There is an outside patio too.

The first thing you notice during breakfast is a fifty cent cup of coffee. This is a bold brew in a paper cup and plastic top. Excellent coffee. For my morning meal I order Chloe's favorite, a six dollar 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, toast, wedge of fruit, plate. The swirled marbled rye bread crafted at John Anthoney's Italian Bread Company was perfect. Potatoes sauteed with fresh chili peppers were tip top. Bacon was thick and so good.

This is one of the areas newest restaurants, and even has a few groceries. Fresh ready to go pre-made lunches, fruit, wine, beer and soft drinks. I would love to recommend at least one bottle water that would come in a paper carton instead of plastic. I took home a bottle of Le Village, Sparkling French Limonade, tasty.

Also a big thanks to Malalay, a super svelte, very friendly gal that not only poured the coffee and brought the food, but laughed with me too. And ^5's to my cook.

While having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried ""Tradiciones"" I would give them a try. 
I enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. 
The salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. 
I was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. 

The platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a ""mole"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! 

The only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. 

While I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.",review,usQTOj7LQ9v0Fl98gRa3Iw,2,2,2

The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth.

While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. 

After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. 

The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. 

The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones.

It is set up more like an apartment and less like a hotel with lots of buildings scattered about, all surrounding a pool. (There is actually more than one pool to make this happen.) It definitely has more of a party vibe than some hotels, which is just fine by me. I can imagine during the summa, summa, summertime these pools are hopping. 

And, even though the feel of the place is fun, the staff of the place is nothing less than professional. Every single person I interacted with was beyond kind, helpful, and happy.

Whether you need a hotel room for a night or a full trip, a place to hang out poolside, a happy hour cocktail, a casual meeting place, or breakfast or lunch I think The Saguaro just might have you covered. And all with a smile.

luCSjoNQ9q_0QIjKKOy2pQ,2008-04-05,TxB2nZN2ntdO5xrEirkpOw,4,"FOOD: I tried the T-Rex (meat lovers pizza), and it was scrumptious. The Thai Peanut Sauce Pizza was a little weird, yet still tasty in its own way, and I could only handle one slice before growing tired of peanut sauce.  The Buffalo Chicken Wing Pizza was also pretty good. The highlight of the menu was the beer. The Elsie's Irish Cream, a milk stout, was one of the best stouts I've had (better than the Left Hand Stout). It had a strong coffee flavor but in a good way (I don't drink coffee). The Orange Blossom (mandarin orange hefeweizen) was the best Hefeweizen I've ever had, and I generally don't like Hefeweizens. The orange flavor definitely made that drink more than tolerable. I tried several other beers from Papago's own brewery, and the rest seemed  good. They have dozens of bottled beers in the fridges along the walls. But I never got a chance to try any of them. 

PRICE: Around $5 per beer on tap. Personal pizzas were $9 and large pizzas that could feed 2-3 people were $18. Appetizers were around $5. 

ATMOSPHERE: Pretty neat place. Funny statues, tvs, darts and all wooden furniture. Drawbacks are very small tables, uncomfortable chairs, odd layout, and almost too loud at times. 

SERVICE: The place seemed a little understaffed at times. We would be helped my a couple employees throughout the night as one would have to run behind the bar to make drinks or clean. All the servers were very nice and patient, but seemed to be a little overwhelmed and, thus, forgot to bring me a drink I ordered. 

SKINNY: Papago Brewing Company Inc has its pros and cons, but overall its a good place. I would definitely go there for the beer, while the pizza is good but nothing to rant about. Some may disagree with me, but I still prefer Tempe's own Four Peaks. I feel Four Peaks' food is better, better seating, and the beers are just as good as Papago's flavors. Don't let this comparison discourage you! Papago's is still a good place to drink and eat.",review,6GJM8bWV3m2cOYPjDjohJA,3,2,0

First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect. 

As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu.

Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..

Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.


Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..



Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. ""I'm a wishful thinker""

Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by ""place was trashed"" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said"", oh sorry forgot"" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.


Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..

Short list

-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.

But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..

Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.

Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. 

At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. 

He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. 



In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. 

I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.


I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.

Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. 

We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). 

For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. 

And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). 

And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)",review,weYT-xJwz8o7mLNWIhD6HA,4,4,3

My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes.

Here is why I can't give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think he's wonderful...)

1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friend's boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited).

2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses.

3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that you'll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, I'll ask for it...just like any other retailer.  

Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctor's cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.  

Hence, why I do most of my shopping online.",review,SIG_tdhVIapMsHzYjIFyAg,0,0,1
YCCDMLcb7UW8G-o_HsWiiA,2009-11-23,U6JvoV0WYiNgUANabXMQsw,3,"Steak, yes, but 2 other words first come to mind when reminiscing about Modern Steak: Retail Therapy.

No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. 

Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:

 - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.

 - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. 

All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. 

Combined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.",review,l4nJ5rCyw_qaFiO0-NLhtw,2,5,2

The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).  

Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well. 

Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed.

Camelback is the perfect mix of central location, unparalleled views and, most importantly, a grueling workout. I love hiking this mountain because of the mix of rock types.

Though South Mountain has a more centralized view, on Camelback you really feel on top of the whole Valley.

We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasn't so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused

The food itself was quite good. The Shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced. 

Considerably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying she'd remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of ""$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash"" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all.

When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself. 

We spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink.

It wasn't worth arguing about at that point.

Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
The food was meh.
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.

The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy! 

Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus! 

I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered. 

My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously! 

Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp!

Decided to take my two nieces to the festival.  Our total cost for 3 of us w/ 2 bracelets before food and extras was $64 - and the girls got on almost every ride, even the big, scary ones!  We went on a Friday at 4ish and the crowd was perfect and relaxed.. absolutely no lines.  Come 6pm, though, that all changed.  The lines got big and it started to not matter to get our bracelets worth of rides for the wait in line (plus the cold night air!).  Also, come 6pm, it just got plain ridiculous with all these little high school kids wearing skimpy clothes and making out and talking bad (where are these kid's parents!?!.. who raised these kids!?!).. it got annoying real quick.

The shows:
- Ostrich Race at 6pm was good - kinda funny, but not that entertaining
- Monkey Show at 9pm was AWESOME - I saw this show last year when we went with the in-laws and I *still* laughed my butt off (easily amused maybe?)
- Petting Zoo - LOVE this.. they had a lot of baby goats (my fave!) and the animals were never menacing and actually very docile.
- In the past I saw the trapeze show and it was entertaining, though the motorcycles in the metal sphere was quite impressive and very entertaining

Overall, the price was decent for the entertainment and the rides the gals got to enjoy; the food was typical fair food (FYI, DO shop around.. prices change across similar products by 2-3$ sometimes, so feel free to shop around for water bottles and other food staples); the staff running the rides were decent people (not creepy, which can be the status quo); the ambiance is good (not OVERLY ghetto) but caution that after 7pm, it gets more crowded with high school kids.. so more lines and more stupid conversations you get to listen to.. yay!",review,A99dyhEqcd_yXKPfBWeZHA,0,1,0

The service was quick and prompt.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale...mmmm.

GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza.  NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings.  AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to.

BADS:  The parking lot sucks.  We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot.  Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe.  Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day.

this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.

the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced ""mah jer lees"" like i had thought.... it's pronounced ""mar lees"". so let me get that out first.

i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc. 

being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:

a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.

the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patrons

the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view. 

so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter.

they took the dvd player, digi cam, and iflip of course. gave me like $33 for those. again, rip.

overall, kind of picky as far as what they take, cuz when i was browsing the shelves, lots of the movies i had/was turning weren't on their shelves.

so instead, i took all my dvds to mo money pawn shop on 12th and indian school and got 85 big green bitchez. 

it looks like they have a ton of books, which is pretty cool, but i believe in a system of free literature, aka the library.

screw you, bookmans!

To start with we had a delicious plate of cheese and meats from the anti pasta menu, along side with some marinated olives and bread w/ olive oil. Just enough to get our taste buds excited and just enough to have my boyfriend (who is not into fancy smancy stuff) say ""give me some more"".  These went nicely with our beers (they've got a great list), my mother's martini (which she seemed to enjoy), and my brother's gin on the rocks (he says they carry a gin that is very rare and delicious but the name didn't stick with me-sorry). 

All of our dinner plates were delicious; fried chicken w/ mashed tatters & biscuits (skin on chicken was a little on the salty side but very crunchy), salmon w/ apple and rice, grilled cheese sliders(who could mess those up?), chicken salad, prime rib dip (served with onion soup instead of au jus, yum yum), and the patato ghesicuto (pasta- I know I can't spell but it was yummy too). Around the table, everyone seemed pretty satisfied.

My only criticisms would be that we were seating just to the side of the kitchen, enough to be able to look inside. I dig places that leave it open so you can watch your foot and the chefs are aware that the client is aware of whats going on BUT I did watch one man on the end prepare countless dishes without gloves on. He went from cutting and laying out proscuitto onto creating their carmel kettle corn dessert (scooping with bare hands), to setting out what appeared to be the fondue app. Yes, there can be worse things that happen in a restaurant but as someone who has worked in food service, it made me squirm a bit. I suppose that's why it's called Culinary Dropout.

Was great until checkout.....
Matthew, a twenty something with brown hair, was fine during the first few minutes of bagging but he asked me if I wanted my pizzas in a bag. I assumed it would be put in one bag per pizza. They were digorno pizzas with the bred sticks or wings.
Matthew told us that they wouldn't fit in a bag. So my boyfriend said it was fine without a bag, but I knew they could fit one in a bag per box. So I asked for a large paper bag. Matthew held up the box to the bag And told me it wouldn't work. I just stood there and continued to place groceries on the line. When I noticed he put one in a bag and the inter in another plastic bag. THEN... Things were getting hostile between the cashier brittani and him. They kept discussing work related topics sucks as the time of the checkout. The cashier seemed irritated with the day that the bagging area was over crowded and backed up. Seemed like she wanted to say something. After that i noticed he was doing s terrible job bagging which caused bags to rip. putting a wide variety of packages in one bag  Matthews attitude changed as well giving a sarcastic goodbye.

After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.

The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).

No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.

Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.

I think my soup could've been more dense with lemon grass and cilantro, but it was yummy anyway. I guess it's cuz I'm a sucker for this dish. I think it's much better at Mailee's in Scottsdale but you pay 5 bucks more.

The place is spartan, not fancy, has some damage, looks like what you would expect by looking at the outside. I'm not picky as long as the place isn't a complete dump.

We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway. 

Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway. 

We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat. 

I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now ""famous"" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza.

If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.

While the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.

The ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.

My first time here was opening night and it was ok...the second time was improved...third time good...etc. Now when I come in the smoke is starting to impermiate in the walls leaving a wonderful smokey resonance in the dining room, and the food has become exponentially better!!!

I am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those ""return for"" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one.

As for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although it's not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palate's stamp of approval. 

A huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!! Being a total whisky slut, I am in heaven here, with dozens of delicious options, and the handful of beers on tap here make me happy for the change in libation after a few too many.

5Feaj6aixO_QxKFnkHf3xg,2009-09-13,EJi2hMav9tkYMnP4JrelUA,4,"Known as ""The Jewel of the Desert"" and the ""Grand Dame,"" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design.  The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is ""Frank and Albert's.""

Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.

When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.

So, my first experience was our dinner at ""Frank and Albert's"", formerly known as the ""Biltmore Grill.""  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their ""bloody rose"" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  

Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.  

Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.

The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...

We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.

The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.

Recommendations:
go to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.

if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.

About Ocatilla:
basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:
complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge
business center (computers, internet, printers)
Wii rentals

First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress. 

We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet. 

The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy.

I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. 

By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.

The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.

I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience.

The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.

Walking in, I did not get the feeling of ""upscale"" restaurant. Sports on 2 TVs blaring out over the bar and into the open dining room did nothing for the atmosphere. They had a long table pulled together for our group in the center of the room, but I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was the first to arrive. Took a few minutes, but the bartender eventually gave me a wine list/menu, answered my questions, and proceeded to get my drink. They had a good selection of wines, and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town.

A few others came in and we moved to the table, no problem transferring tabs. Seemed to take a long time between everyone (about 15 of us, though we initially expected 20) receiving their drinks and the time the first apps came out. Granted, they were complimentary (the deal I worked out for my group), and they were quite yummy - especially the spicy tuna on tempura eggplant - so once we started eating, we forgot about the wait. The pate was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread. Some were immediately addicted to the bacon-wrapped dates.

Everyone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opting for the pre-selected toppings, other customizing and adding sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was on separate checks. My burger came out not quite as rare as I would have liked, but what do you expect when the patty is only 1/2"" thick? I am not a big beef fan, anyway. Sauces were good, especially the pungent garlic parm, as were the fries.

But then, we waited for the checks...and waited...and waited. Seems the staff didn't begin trying to sort out who had what until at least HALF AN HOUR AFTER everyone had finished eating and plates had been cleared! And none clearly knew how to use the POS system. Those who had cash eventually tired of waiting and just left it on the table. Those of us with credit cards were not so lucky...and several bills had to be re-rung, as they did not include the right items.

Maybe I am just a fuddy duddy, but it seems that the clientele are cougar-like women, aged 30-50, with bleached hair and sequin tops. I expected a quiet wine bar, but instead it is more like a loud night club.

The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole ""we-wish-we-were-a-club"" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.

Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. 

Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like ""uh, I kind of want to order too""

Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating. Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud. They had a DJ playing music so loud, having a conversation was impossible (and we ended up sitting pretty far from the speakers!). We left a soon as we finished our dinners (didn't stay for more wine or dessert) because the music was just too annoying.",review,98jhrpmyYcLLM0-9z-r2oA,0,2,3

I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email.

Of course, this is not to imply that Pie-Zanos is staffed by mouth-breathing ""pizza artists"" or stocked with sub-par ingredients and generally filthy.  On the contrary, this ""Subway of Pizza"" is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza. 

Pie-Zanos allows you to pick from wheat or white dough and from up to 8 different sauces.  From there you can add herbs and crust flavoring and then you can pick from 6-8 different cheeses.  Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings you'll find anywhere.   The fare is basically affordable as long as you don't go apeshit on toppings (55 cents each after the first).   As a special bonus they have Pepsi products.   

I have also enjoyed the breadshits which are fresh and delightful and pair nicely with the traditional red marinara as well as the tomato-pesto. 

My only complaints with Pie-Zanos and what keeps it from achieving 5 stars is how busy it gets at lunch, limited indoor seating and the fact that they allow children's birthday parties which, when mixed with ubiquitous bad parenting, quickly turns a hip and snazzy pizza joint into a Chuck-E-Cheese's.",review,8RzsGBVrqLWLCE8sOSYQkw,4,6,1

Here's the problem(s) I have with the venue or CONS so to speak.

1. Cash Only almost EVERYWHERE, for a stadium named after a bank, don't you think someone would have taken finacial practice into better concern, perhaps CHASE just wants to sucker you more by making you pay their ATM fees if your not a member which I see as ""Greedy Fat Cat"" practices. 

2. No real options in regards to ""regular"" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they don't even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture. Other than that it's just another typical ""let's capitalize all we can"" with your typical crap chains (Fridays, Panda Express, etc) which I find pretty disgusting.  

3. The ""Value"" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a ""value"" at 4 dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA.


Here's the PROS.

1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 15 bucks a person, Not too shabby! 

2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is. 

3. There's a pool in the outfield, cool idea 

4. Parking is rather cheap (12 bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue.

5. Traffic control before and after games is surprisingly smooth

Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.

CleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?

I highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This 
saves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.

The one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.

First things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.

The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut ""Rumbi rice"".

We also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.

For dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.

Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?

DINNER:

Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered ""All Day Happy Hour,"" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their ""Half and Half."" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. 

My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. 

Overall, the food is average ""bar style"" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. 

JUST DRINKS:

Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)

As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! 

Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. 

SO WHY GO? 
Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)

If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!",review,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA,3,4,0

Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!",review,VW1zLVadNrWZgYBCueSFow,0,0,0
LcAamvosJu0bcPgEVF-9sQ,2012-12-26,edBjosp0Rk9qM1M5Vwlj7g,4,"I purchased the introductory groupon they offered a few weeks ago, and was hesitant at first because I haven't had the greatest experiences using groupons.  I was pleasantly surprised.

I did look at some of the bad yelp reviews before going in, which made me nervous! So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.

I had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was ""impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush,"" she was ""equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl."" So she broke out the curling iron!

We made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.

The salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!

Another good tip is to plan for longer than 45 minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for 1 hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).

I will be back in January for my 25th birthday night!",review,_6seymnSl8rS-pw801ENAg,0,1,0

Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. 

I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. 

Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. 

Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. 

It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. 

This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"". 

Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't. 

Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy. 

The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1.

I've eaten here for over a decade. I've brought friends, college classmates, relatives, and dates here. I lost my dad 3 years ago and I have fond memories of dining here with him. I distinctly remember spilling a Coke all over myself the first time I brought him here. I also remember coming here on my very last day of law school, with a bunch of classmates from Employment Law. The folks here have seen their share of special occasions in my life. Wouldn't be true if this were truly just a 2 star experience. 

I don't think it's fair to nail a restaurant with a bad review based on only a single visit, in most circumstances. Restaurants are run by humans, who are allowed to have a bad day now and then. I've eaten here a billion times. Occasionally something has annoyed me. Most of the time the service is prompt. And those things are true of every restaurant I've ever frequented more than once. At JOTC, even if it's not prompt, it has not even once been unfriendly. There is an elderly gentleman waiter in particular who I especially like. A non-Indian friend I came here with once asked him, ""So, what part of India are you from?"" The waiter look back puzzled and said in his typically mild and hushed manner, ""Sir, I am from Mexico City."" We LOL'd. 

It's #2 on my list of Indian restaurants in the Valley, which is pretty good. Since Tandoori Times is so close by it almost always wins out on a given night, over the past year or so. But the fact remains that JOTC is solidly #2. 

The food is good, by my Indian standards. Samosas: awesome. Chicken tikka masala: very good. I tried the bhindi masala once and that didn't turn out too well. A unique JOTC feature is that dishes are served in very cute, traditional-looking, brass or copper Indian pots. 

Little details like that lead me to say that the decor and atmosphere here probably beat out Tandoori Times and every other Indian place. Simple but elegant, with old Indian art on the walls and cool room dividers thoughtfully placed throughout. The outdoor seating is very pleasant, with heaters to warm you up during winter. The location only adds to the reason to eat here. It's in a cool space next to the Scottsdale Civic Center, a few yards away from AZ 88. It's a solid place to come with a group to eat, drink, and enjoy some good conversation.

JOTC doesn't blow me away (thus only 4 stars), but it needs to be said that if you live in the Valley it is worth at least one visit if you like Indian food, which you wouldn't be able to tell from the other reviews. Judge for yourself.",review,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw,1,3,0

PsKAMRgeydy54ytW8xWKCw,2010-01-11,oQ3ZMhZD9C4VF6DKX3gkpg,4,"Okay, it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive reviews of this place, but I just have to. 

I'm not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and I've eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice.

We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after we'd had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply ""okay"". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.

Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.

All up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?

I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.

I'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and I've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian.

Most of the people we're eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasn't the only table available AND the rest of us we're eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us.
Our order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.  
My biggest complaint is that we we're ignored unless we we're actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure.",review,UwD8Ho0PsEwxthdxrCrewQ,0,1,0

The catering service was excellent and finally at game time we enjoyed watching the DBacks come from behind to beat the Padres. The suites above centerfield have poor visibility because of the size of the ball park.

Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full.  We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters.  The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year. 

Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.  The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like.  The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them.  The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted.

The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them.

The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food.

I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.

I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-

Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor. 

Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg. 

Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good. 

We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.

Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts.

At Grimaldi's, they refuse to carry ranch because they don't want people dipping their pizza in it. At Boombozz, they offer ranch as soon as they set down the pizza.

So no, Boombozz is definitely not the best pizza that I've ever had, but for their style of pizza, they are pretty good. Think traditional Domino's/Papa John's type crust with stepped-up, unique toppings and sauce. My husband said the crust tasted like a cheesy breadstick, and I think that's a pretty accurate description. We got the D'Sienna with an interesting tomato cream sauce, spinach, and tomatoes. The low quality cheese detracted from it overall, but it was still much better than the pizza at Oregano's.

Boombozz is relatively new to town, but they seem to know their crowd well. It was pretty busy when we visited midweek.

1oFvqm7eSpJbVpxpPxueaA,2008-01-09,QMU906B86pFCpp4lOUOteg,1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.


It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.

When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.",review,SbzANP6hRVwDU5pbtz5ANw,7,6,14

SX0pCDRvuTEoXobTovJEIQ,2010-06-04,1D8buGjiJ6lZ5ZvvAjVOfA,4,"I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.

The 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American

What makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again

For me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.",review,B8HTR0tC1NFe4yAuUV3tGw,1,3,0
CYMG5AsrhkhUPro2c6NSUA,2012-06-06,hVcICtxo4arSv8n1iPHWiw,4,"I dug this place. Got a great deal from Priceline, and I pretty much knew what to expect going in. I've stayed at places like this before across the country, and I can definitely say that this was a very pleasant experience. Everyone has complained about the beds being hard, but I didn't really find this to be the case. I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that's just my personal preference, but it wasn't like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it's just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days.

I have to make special mention of one thing- the pillows, for some reason, were absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I both agreed (and we're both flight attendants, so we KNOW hotels) that these were some of the best hotel pillows we've ever slept on. Couldn't exactly tell you why, but there was just something about them- proper amount of spring, cushioning, support, punchability, etc. 

If you need to be in Arizona on business, you couldn't pick a better place. The convenience is amazing- you're right near the highway and there's quite a bit of stuff within walking distance. We got some DELICIOUS takeout from some of the local restaurants, and it was SUPER Handy to have a microwave and kitchenette available within the room for our use!

So yeah, I gotta say, I didn't mind this place one tiny little bit. If you're used to Marriotts, Hyatts, and other fancy hotels, then you need to know that this isn't one of them.

First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.

Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry ""shooters"" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!

We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.

IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars. 

There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)

I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.

I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though.

We were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels.  When she was asked about the ""specials"", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?

We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:

Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.

Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small
in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.

Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.

recommended Food:
Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.
Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.
Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.
Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.
Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.
Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.

Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade ""adult"" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!

We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.

Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.

My husband ordered a dirty martini and it was so dirty, it came out looking like a glass of olive juice with some grenadine in it - it was actually red - WTH? It was the first time in his life he had sent something back. The waitress was cool about it though. She had to be, she has eyeballs too. We ordered the mozzarella and heirloom tomato appetizer. It was ok, nothing special. I have a pet peeve though - if you say heirloom, I expect heirloom and heirloom tomatoes, they were not. If they are not in season, that's fine, but tell people when they order. Then, we had the cannelloni special with sausage sauce. Again, nothing special. Here's the kicker - they charge for bread (not special bread, just plain ol' bread) and for parmesan cheese to put on top of your pasta!!! In fairness, they do give you one piece of bread with your pasta, but if you want any more, you are paying $3. Let's be serious - the name of the restaurant is Pasta Bar and you charge for grated cheese?? That's like going to a sushi restaurant and paying for soy sauce or a burger place and paying for ketchup. The cheese actually on the menu as a side. Are you kidding me? We're not talking special grated cheese. It looked like the stuff from a green shaker bottle. I wanted to add some salt to our appetizer, but there was none on the table.

I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.
I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  
The server behing the bar was ""professionally friendly""  
Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.
Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.
The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.
The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong ""and vinegary"". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.
The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is.

I was really excited to score a seat at the sushi bar, eagerly hoping to chat it up w/ the sushi chefs. However, they seemed too flustered w/ all the orders that they made a minimal attempt to talk to me besides asking, ""is everything ok?"" And I think the Mexican sushi chef is new so the Japanese sushi chef had to instruct him on certain things a few times. 

I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi, per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef. While it tasted fresh, it was very blah to me... nothing special about it at all. 

A few minutes later, the waitress arrived to take my drink order. I decided to just stick w/ water and told her I was ready to order a few items off the paper menu. I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!

Anyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to ""cut"" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki. 

Since I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good.

It is a little pricey, but it's all about the experience.  Also, since it's a time-consuming experience, one tends to be there about twice as long as at a regular restaurant.  So I don't really mind the price for a once in a while kind of thing.  My hubbie and I have been 8-10 times... twice at the Scottsdale location.

The husband and I always order the ""Big Night Out,"" generally the ""Lobster Indulgence.""  (We figure if we're going to spend a pretty penny, we might as well really make it worthwhile.)  Maybe since we always do the lobster thing, the price doesn't bother me as much.

Don't remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the ""Big Night Out"" meals go like this:  Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the ""Lobster Indulgence,"" it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part... Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruit, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies Treats, etc.  Yummy!

We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with ""sliders"" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.

Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.

There were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.  All things considered, I don't think I'd head back here.  I can get a better steak at a Chili's-type place, and the atmosphere (comprised mainly of your younger Scottsdale-types) didn't really do all that much for me.

The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!
This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry ""panang"" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.
I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.
Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license.",review,VA5zvXwaaj81_tjiQCH2mg,1,1,1
n-Q7d10K0h6PyNewmiHLyg,2009-04-20,Q-rFjI37_DYuyZc_rFuCng,3,"Let's start with an SAT-type question:

Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.

a) Oakland A's
b) Rickey Henderson
c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium
d) Yankee Stadium

If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.

Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.

We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  

There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.

The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.

Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.

So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.",review,ca_Q9OGfyjwOnfvXqmhdIg,2,2,2

I have been looking for a restaurant like this since I left Chicago 5 years ago.  The style was perfect, the prices were not exorbitant, the food was delicious, the service was tremendous.

We had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.  

One complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....

Anyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.

Our server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...

Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out. 

Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers, all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In ""N Out's thinner patties.

I've come here a lot with friends late night, and the food was always scrumptious and service excellent, but after last night I MUST PROTEST.

I ordered the Bourbon BBQ Wings, a promising title appealing to my tastes exactly. They arrive with a generous bowl of ranch and a few stalks of celery. I know most people don't eat the celery, maybe that's why, so I guess carrots were out of the question.

THE WINGS WERE FROM BABY CHICKENS!!!
I was shocked. some of them (both sections) were not 1.5 inches long, I swear. The sauce was yummy BUT I'M ANGRY ABOUT THE WING SIZE!!!! 

Come on 5& Diner, you're better than Long Wong's, ACT LIKE IT and serve up goodness on all fronts!
(See my scathing review on them as well.) I want so much to write a glowing review here but NO.

So my friend got the Southwestern eggrolls. They were sliced open diagonally and nicely presented on the plate. I tried one, and eventually my friend let me have the last 2. They were hard and irritating to eat, and tasted fine for tourists as it reminded me of Rubio's or Arriba's standard. I think Jack In The Box could've put out a better product overall.

Another friend got the chicken quesedilla.
Although I didn't taste it, presentation looked nice with the pico and guac on the side. The quesedillas were a good size and thickness. My friend took half of it home.

I can recommend the burgers, onion rings, and breakfasts.

Prices went up a couple of years ago to an average $9.49 for a burger plate, and slightly less for appetizers and other things. Service is always good, but don't go if you're in a hurry and the place is packed.

The eldest ordered the poco chimis off of the appetizer menu. Much as he liked them, he was full with 2 chimis left. My husband (who received the leftovers) found the filling a bit dry, and the jalapeno cream cheese too bland to deserve the 'jalapeno' in its name.

My green corn tamales were a tad sweet for my taste, reminiscent of El Torito sweet corn cake. No problem though, since the youngest gobbled up half!

If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.

We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best. 
Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side.",review,Obtx8kRJAwV8AlmNH3x0Rw,0,2,0

They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.

I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well. 

Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.

As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  ""Cool!"" as I exclaimed to myself. 

It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!

After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.

Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.

Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!

The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.

The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.

Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.

I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.

I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.

I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review.",review,hjJPKQ1Ah91h3fVbc8GsOg,1,4,1

In the case of tires, I have to make an exception. 

You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. 

For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. 

The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). 

Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT.",review,aTi0NVrcPJWbN6jAsJVcAw,0,2,0

Not only that but people were indifferent about dancing in groups with strangers. I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or 4 and there was no welcoming. I was disappointed.

The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.

We decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but I am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasn't packed full of flavor. The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasn't gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? can't remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I don't think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high.

This was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful. We had a great experience here and are looking forward to returning! I definitely recommend people try this!",review,KsQQOQ3ngmh_Yk6RmTo2ug,0,0,0

The great service
The 10% off by checking in on yelp - yay!
The complimentary cinnimon sugar donuts at the end which are HOME MADE - dayum, those things were awesome
The pineapple drink - its a real pineapple filled with a ton of alcohol but guess what? It tastes like juice...which means its dangerous. Drink at your caution.

RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA,2011-05-07,CEwceGp5g2Qg1pMFkiMuaA,4,"Last night was my first adult play experience. I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but that's about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play ""The Mystery of Irma Vep"" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend. 

We got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans. 

However the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black ""Friday"" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it. 

After coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this, and I was surprised my husband liked this as much as he did. A good time had by all!",review,2nXFEyQ06RfcdAXIPbxuwA,0,0,0

Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.

Too bad, really. Because when they first opened up, they had a real Japanese chef who had a respectable career and was trying to make actual Japanese cuisine. He naturally didn't last long in this 1980s pseudo-asian theme park environment. Remember when the owner used to intermittently drop the screens down and fire up the THX system and play movie trailers from last year? The chefs couldn't even see their hands. Now that's setting your priorities!

Happy hour and late night patio is this place's saving grace (for others, not for me). But it's so far from Japanese food/sushi as to make them guilty of false advertising.

Also, if you are planning on attending a show here, plan on paying for parking.

I have seen some terrible sound guys here, but it's hard to say if that is the fault of the Marquee - a lot of bands that would play here tour with sound people.

The majority of the problems here are problems with venues of this size everywhere in the country - the parking, the over-priced shitty beer, the strip-search upon entry, the lack of re-entry.

Still, if there was any competition for a venue in that part of the Valley that could handle bands that are as popular as the bands that play at the Marquee, they'd be hard-pressed to do a less-enthusiastic job of it.

My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (I'd usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. don't get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple.

FYI - there's a check-in deal here! $.01 margarita! Mmhmm you saw that right! Certainly not the best I have had by any means but you can't really go wrong for that price right?

After ordering our drinks we decided to splurge on an appetizer so we started out with the Queso Fundido. I was so excited about it because hey it should be all about the cheese and as a Wisconsin boy, I'm all about it! Unfortunately it was more about the spinach and not so much about the queso - it tasted really good, just missing a lot of the main ingredient in my opinion...

He ordered the Mexico City Fajitas! Really well cooked chicken, with the right amount of everything! Super good! I ordered the Pollo Rellano. The chicken (as in the previous dish) was really well cooked but was lacking on the stuffed part. So it was good - just nothing wow worthy. My dish came with side of guajillo mashed potatoes - which look like a pile of mashed sweet potatoes - I personally wasn't a huge fan of the taste but as usual I'll finish my plate anyway :)

The service was pretty good, it was just a very laid back environment, which I wasn't really expecting for some reason.

As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! 

While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. 

In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: 

- The very friendly staff
- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! 
- Clean decor 
- Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see 
- A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. 

I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular.

Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.

 I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! 

But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. ""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right."" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up ""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up"". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that.

When checking out their menu online I saw they have my favorite beer on tap, SeaDog Wild Blueberry. It was delicious! Completely different on draft, but yummy all the same. They also had an Apple Cider on draft, my pick over a pear cider any day, that I could have in my Black Velvet (cider and Guinness). I was a happy camper. 

Only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked, but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers.

But the beans don't have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort.

No, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:)

Why can't Starbucks do that?

I occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:)

I have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it ""the place where space and time folds in on itself""...I say ""why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?""...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:)

In and of itself, that's no reason for a 2 star review...Gordon Gecko said it best...""Greed is Good!"" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peet's Coffee...I have no problem with success:)

No, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...it's second or third rate, at best.

And just because it's convenient doesn't mean we all need to stop in.

There is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...it's worth looking for another meeting spot:)",review,du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g,8,9,7

I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.

I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's.

My biggest problem with this place was the price of the food.  It is just too expensive for what amounts to frozen food plopped into a deep fryer.

Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.

Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.

Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.

So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.

And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.

So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...

They're pricing is usually pretty high on records/artists/genres that are popular or trendy.  That's pretty standard for anyplace.  The Ghost of Eastside keeps their prices slightly lower with more obscure selection.

However, the flipside is that Zia will overlook gems in their used stock and price them pretty low.  Probably because they don't know much about certain band line-ups, labels or releases in general.  I've found quite a few gems for two or three bucks in the used section.  

Used records are where it's at.  There is no rationale in buying anything new because they'll press those things in such high numbers that they're not rare anymore.  I'll still buy some new things from bands and such.  Not a lot.

There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  

First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!

Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.

Much has already been praised about this little gem, and I agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere, the service, the food...it was all wonderful. 

We had the Fuego salad, which was huge and lovely (although I would have liked some diced onions on it; maybe I'll ask next time), the tortilla soup (husband raved about this), the Pulled Pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and maple-glazed carrots, and the panko-breaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and maple-glazed carrots. 

In all it was delectable. The entrees were succulent and nicely plated. I particularly loved the creamed corn, which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses (I succumbed to a bad cold the next day, so maybe I need some more!).

The only thing I would not order again is the carrots. I didn't feel these added anything to our dinners. The maple taste was pretty subtle, to the point of being nonexistent. Also, I think that if you're going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant, go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged ""baby carrots"" that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines. It will look better.

This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return
 

Original Review:
 First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. 
Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. 

Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  
Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   
 
The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. 

Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  

Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. 

Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.

Were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.     The jukebox played ""i'm too sexy "" by Right said fred  WTF that really  messed up the ambience.Country bars don't have NIN on the box after all.",review,N3L6SDymSRkYQtTiSDmXSg,3,3,2

I used to go to OSF in Newport Beach, CA way back in the '70s, & I was somewhat amazed that they are still around & that there's one in Phoenix!

Stepping inside, this is the most junked-up restaurant I've ever been to!!!  Ok, except maybe Bahooka Ribs & Grog!*  It's a big place, with soft lighting inside, & rooms all over the place stuffed with tons of furniture, barrels, & so on, cluttering up every one of them!  It's all on purpose, of course, & my booth in the midst of all this craziness was actually completely ok.  (The floor elevation is up & down all over the place, too!) 

Ok, so for my first time (in about 35 years!) I just ordered the ""Pasta Classics - Rich Meat Sauce"", which is their way of saying, ""Spaghetti.""

Some good things:

*  I started with a cup of coffee, & it was excellent!

*  Pretty soon came a mixed lettuce salad, which was simple, but the Ranch Dressing was really tasty!

*  The next thing to hit the table was a little loaf about three by eight inches of hot Sourdough bread, with a cup of whipped garlic butter, all on a breadboard with a suitable knife for cutting it.  It was great!!

A couple of less wonderful things:

*  Some girl (from the kitchen?) brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad.

*  I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok, but not great.

Bottom line:  They give you plenty to eat here.  My meal included the beverage, salad (or soup), the hot bread, entree, & dessert.  It was nice & filling, & a good value at $9.99 for everything.    :-)

LYyGQgL60VKdV-p_9OxmWQ,2010-01-07,75WRKGIQMMXhKMeUuCIY3w,5,"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't like the buffet, though my friends from work think it's a good value. However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried. 

Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).

Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that! 

Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.",review,8VikyrWXFKL8GU1a9t-o6Q,1,1,0

The pizza just wasn't that good. It's just way too sweet. And when I say sweet,  it's so extreme that it overshadows anything else about their pizza.  It's so different in taste, it makes it seem like the wrong sauce was used. (I know it wasn't)

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.",review,0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q,5,5,4

Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though. 

Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough. 

If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.

It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.

WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS:
Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!

I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.

We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much ""wrapper"" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.

I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.

The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.

There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). 

I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? 

On and on it went. 

My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal. 

Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.",review,qZrArI2ohkYkQlELl13BKQ,5,2,4

They no longer sell DnD books, or Dice sets which breaks my heart. They always had the best selection when it came to dice and I haven't been able to find another place that carries more than 5-6 at a time.

Certainly the concept of healthy, sustainable, locally bought food is great (albeit in the form of an upscale-chain), but overall, True Food didn't live up to the hype.

On the positive side, the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty, and my Ginger Margarita was excellent. 

On the not-so-positive side, the raw ahi tuna app-special was just OK, and the tiny slivers of fish (maybe 8 total?) were more of a ""taste"" than a full appetizer. Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible. Added to the long wait (weekend dinner reservations are a must even though the restaurant is huge) and the pay-parking lot (if you stay more than two hours, which we did because of the long wait), we all came away mildly disappointed.

It was really good, I like the mixed greens in place of the usual romaine and although I didn't taste much cilantro it had great flavor.

Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.

When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  

There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.

There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.

I had one of their smoothies, just like the one at Cheesecake Factory.  It was good, but I have had better at Jumba Juice.  I ended up having their angel hair pasta, my cousin had a chicken salad, and friend #3 decided that he would just mooch off our plates.

I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.

They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.

The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).

Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.

I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway.

I have had numerous irritating experiences at Jerry's.  In a nutshell...
I use red Prismacolor pencils.  I run out and go to Jerry's, they don't have them, don't know if they carry them and and nobody can tell me when and if they might reappear.  Why?  The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials. 
""Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and we'll check if it's in...""   
I can walk to Jerry's in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and it's there the next day.  

The clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.
They do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.
I spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   ""No clue.""

My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.  I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.

Whole Foods Market.
Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today. 
But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as:

*crow's feet
*saddlebags
*sagging butt and or tits, 
*and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in.

You've got a choice to make.

Spend all your money now on organic, free range shit, this in an effort to remain healthy looking, or, shop for a lot of the same stuff at Costco, where you can load up, get twice your money's worth, and have a shitload of cardboard boxes you won't have a clue what to do with. 

But the real bonus will be how in only a few short years, you'll have saved enough money for a good plastic surgeon, which you're going to need anyway if you have any plans to remain living in Scottsdale for any length of time.

My opinion?
I highly recommend the latter and here's why.

Scottsdale has a serious shortage of fish-lipped women with feline looking facial features, who routinely wear yoga pants telegraphing their hiked-up thongs. 
Poor thong....how sad that your fate...to be cast to a fifty-something, saggy-butt host.
Ladies, is that what you want?
To idly standby, watching, as the ranks of this bass-cat looking oddity dwindle in population?
I didn't think so.

The choice is yours.
Beautiful and broke from shopping at Whole Foods today.
Or, aging not so gracefully with the help of medical science, an overzealous plastic surgeon, and Victoria's Secret, which I assure you with one of her thongs in yoga pants will be anything but. 
A lot of good all that free range organic crap did. 

If you do come here, try the hot deli, where you can get every kind of ethnic food, save for Ethiopian. It helps after a late night at work, on your way home, when you don't feel like eating fast food. They also have a taco and pizza bar, fresh bakery, and a smoked meats section where you can get some of the worst barbecue and smoked meats I've ever tasted.

Whether it was fight night on a Saturday evening or a lazy Tuesday dinner, I never was worried about the overall experience at that location.

This location, on the other hand, could take some hints from there now defunct location to the west.  I have been to this location 4 times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.

I won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.  On multiple occasions a buddy of mine who I went with each time felt compelled to recite Reservoir Dogs lines when it came to drink refills.  They were few and far between.  Finally, I don't sit at the bar because I like to speak with the company I am in, but that was virtually impossible.  This wasn't just on event nights either.  The volume of the speakers didn't vary anytime, not even in the middle of the week during lunch.

It's just an awesome amazing experience. 

They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end. I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument, and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.

The Parlor is definitely The Vig's little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud. 

Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender. 

After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud. 

On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning. 

For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.

I'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!

My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I don't know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose.

Man.. I still don't know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6' tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didn't smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but it's a 3 for now until things settle down a bit.",review,MWt24-6bfv_OHLKhwMQ0Tw,10,10,10

In search for a cute independently owned cupcakery to test how AZ cupcakes stack up to SF Bay cuppies... we headed to downtown Scottsale. WELL, not really for the cupcakes, but just to check it out. However, seeing there were a handful of cupcakeries nearby, we had to try one.

BUT the reviews of 2 and 3 stars for some of these places seriously put me off. I hate dry cupcakes and I was not eager to spend precious calories on something that would not satisfy. Sprinkles had the better reviews and whala it was open after all the other places closed. (Note to self, who closes a bakery at 6pm? Cupcake freaks come out at NIGHT!)

We have a Sprinkles about a 15 min drive from us@home, but have I ever gone??? NO. So yes here we are at Sprinkles in AZ. The gals are friendly, they answer my questions tirelessly. I end up with 2, lemon and chocolate marshmallow.

They stay overnight in our hotel room since our dinner left absolutely no room for cupcakes. I was worried they'd be dry and stale the next morning when I busted them out at 7am before my workout. Gotta get some carbs in so I can burn them off right?

Bottom line... Sprinkles may not be a cute little indy shop any longer but their stuff is solid. No mixes, the dark chocolate cupcakes are the perfect combo of dark, bitter, and sweet. The lemon was dense, I think mine is better, but the chocolate marshmallow OMG. It was like a grownup version of a Hostess cupcake, MY FAVORITE. Despite their overnight rest, they were not dry, the result of a fair amount of oil if the residue on my fingers was any indication.

Service was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant. 

When it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time. 

Vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasn't impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu.

Talking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious.

Zoyo popped up and the reviews were good so I asked my daughter if she wanted dessert.  Silly me, of course she said yes! It was a short drive to Zoyo.  I passed it the first time cause my GPS said it was on my right but nooooo it was on the left.  We made a quick u-turn and there we were.  

It was clean and well lit and nicely laid out.  If I remember correctly there were either 10 or 12 different flavors.  I had Red Velvet and Banana.  YUM!  The Red Velvet was delish!  My daughter had RV and Cake Batter.  They had all the standard toppings and the topping area as well as the yougurt area was very clean.  The young people (oh god I sound old!) that were tending to the counter were pretty efficient and friendly.  There was pleanty of seating too.  Some nice larger, round tables and then what looked like a hallway had some smaller tables for two.  There were also tables outside.  It was a Saturday night and there seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in while we were there.  Some stayed, some got theirs to go.  They also had two flat screen tvs on the wall .  One was playing The Bee Movie and the other had Soccer.  Overall our experience here was a good one and we will be back.  I may even bump it up to 5 stars after I try more flavors.

Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.

Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.  

Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.

The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!

She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly. 

I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.

In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger. 

The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.

The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.

My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.

The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.

Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didn't matter at this point.

I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face). 

I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest.

And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. 

Eggplant.

Ohhhhkay then. 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.

So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.

It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?

Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said ""SURE!"" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? ""SURE! But be careful it's hot."" And oh so YUM!

I think they deserve the taglines ""Have it your way"" and ""Any way you want it"" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said ""No"" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.

Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.

But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.

My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.

The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didn't work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta. 

Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know. 

I sort of liked the red sangria, but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria, as it was pretty sweet and not very strong.

They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night.

I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.

At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. 

Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. 

When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.

Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. 

The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!",review,BDQjq30H2gFncFvaapvm6A,1,2,1

VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ,2010-04-21,8zw-XQNUZMRWMSDXA1nMXg,5,"Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After 
Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. 
When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". 
And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. 
At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! 
So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!",review,Y0aovX_kbraKpdLYCzVHKA,4,5,2

That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking.

The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable. 

So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious.

I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.

We aren't golfers.  We came to see AZ.  We were in an interesting spot to do it ... we spent most of our time in the Superstition Mountains and Phoenix and then did one day trip into Sedona.  So from a proximity perspective, if you are interested in seeing more than just the Grand Canyon, it's a good spot.

Regarding accomodations, we really liked our little condo.  Although the furniture selection was a little random (like why have a love seat but no sofa), it was definitely adequate.  The beds were comfortable.  And we LOVED having our own private hot tub.  We discussed several times that we should maybe install one at the house!!  It was just great to get in a soak after a long day of touring.

We also really liked the restaurant on site.  There's not much to choose from in terms of eats in Apache Junction but the Kokopelli's was really nice.  I had a delicious salad with strawberries, blue cheese, and grilled chicken one night and fish over pasta the next.  Both were fabulous.  There was live music and the service was really good.  We met some super interesting people and so the conversation was flowing.  It was just a really enjoyable place to spend a night under the AZ sky!

One kind of crazy thing that happened was there was a huge mud slide that wiped out part of the golf course and filled the parking lot.  We couldn't drive into the resort for a couple of hours one evening as a result.  Luckily, they reopened the kitchen to serve us since we were late arriving.

Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.

Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.

I cannot believe how long it took me to finally get there, but it was worth the wait.  I went with a group of four on a Monday night.  (1/2 Price Bottles of Wine from 5pm - close on Mondays; needless to say, we took advantage of that special!)

We let my friend Anthony do the ordering since he'd been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts... We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!  

Along the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he's fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.

We had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.  

I have a feeling it won't take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.

I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when it's still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so I'd recommend reservations. If you can't get reservations, I'd caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff that's trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if they're not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkley's, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I can't really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish that's always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if it's on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. I've only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I don't have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picasso's phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - there's here was watery and blubbery).

Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.

Detail:

Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.

I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.

It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.

Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.

UB's seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open it's arms and bar to the metal community. 

As far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall. 

As far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the ""dive-ness"" this place exhibits. 
Their beer menu had 4 or 5 typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, O'Dools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way).

(what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter). Not a difficult task. She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back. WHAT??!
I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it). She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process.

VKNl2-aF4n1x7lPVyU-Mag,2011-04-02,ovvWjSlkAt2lUeaFajvOvg,4,"Imagine this, a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices, fantastic food and attentive top-notch service? Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more. 

Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. 

I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.

The ""Shooters"" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. 

If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey ""Chop"" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. 

The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. 

While the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.",review,lPaYMDmJbAnv_3pmZH_inw,4,5,2

The portion was pretty good for the $8. But the chicken had a tuna-texture I wasn't expecting. But the greens tasted fresh and there was just enough dressing for my preference. I haven't tried anything else beyond a chai latte which was pretty standard. Some of their pastries look good but I wonder if the muffins are from Costco.

As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! 

The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving!

The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.

That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else.

It was literally impossible to cut into bite-sized pieces, and was tasteless besides.  

Then, after at least a half an hour wait, pasta with chanterelles.  The shrooms were great, and I have to say I enjoyed fennel for the first time in my life, but the pasta was enormous in size and there was an awful lot of it.

But one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes, which were wonderful, and another had the brussell sprouts, also wonderful, and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine.

Sweet potato fries were really, really good as well. I did not try the waffle fries, but my husband liked them & he is a waffle fry snob.

Had the pulled pork, spicy sausage, beef brisket, ribs...all of it delicious.  They have a wide variety of sauces you get to pick out & add yourself, or just eat the meat straight up.

My 12 year old daughter said that ""the food tastes like the air smells when you go camping"" (she was referring to that delicious smokey flavor...it was cute to me).

The place is small, but I don't blame them for that--you have to be able to establish yourself in this economy or you'll go under.  Hopefully they will be able to expand someday.  Driving out from Mesa won't be easy!!",review,lfx2ppICJdX-rjT8Z8anXw,0,1,0

I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.

I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.

I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.

I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.

Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. 
Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage! 
The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY! 
I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!

Despite the fifty-some-odd write-ups, I wasn't sure what to expect. I read something about an ice cave, live comedy, hanging man meat, and surveillance cameras, but despite these oddities what drew me in was the promise of expertly crafted crepes and the opportunity to see the chefs do their stuff on a closed circuit TV.

Le Chalet did not disappoint. Sit in the front dining area to view the chefs at work in the open kitchen, or take a seat in the dining area by the bar where two flat screens showcase the action at the crepe griddles. The Bretonne crepe with ham, mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and a sunny-side up egg was superb, and I can't wait to go back and try the La Landaise, blinis topped with seared fois gras, apple, and balsamic glaze.

I also tried La Potence (the ""hanging man""), filet medallions served on a medieval looking mace, seared tableside with bourbon and served with a pineapple slice, rice, and some mayo-based dipping sauces. Thoroughly enjoyable, but next time I would opt instead for a cheese fondue or the melted Raclette plate with cured meats, which looked delicious.

The ambiance seemed a bit strange to me, but homey and comfortable. And yes, there is a sculpted ice cave for performances, The night I attended was slated for ""clean comedy"" and I made it a point to get out of there despite some morbid curiosity (I'm not an amateur comedy fan, and the idea of family-friendly comedy made me even more anxious).

The handsome server was very attentive and knowledgeable, and I loved the half-carafe option when ordering wine. I wouldn't classify Le Chalet as a ""fondue place"", where the experience often outshines the food; it's more of a casual cozy spot that serves up thoughtfully prepared comfort cuisine - all the ingredients for a lovely dinner out.",review,gJEJg1fPVDPnkdcVFbVlBQ,1,4,2

The other night I was at a bar.  two days later I heard that it was Turf.  So I'm gonna go with it.  In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened.

For example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?)

Was I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede)

Did I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope.

Her: ""flex your stomach so I can hit you.""
Me: ""Are you joking?  that's me, flexing.""  (#fat)

so I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely can't say for sure if that was the place we were at.

That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)

The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  

We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.

We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.

We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.

Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  

I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:

1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  

2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.

Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!",review,obNXmSNJ-DjzJC3nzfVkDg,3,4,0

We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.

This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.

The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.

Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.

A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:

Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it.
Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60"" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.

Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches.",review,xV59HB14hq4XTecr3dFibw,0,0,0

_GS1R0LTwr6h8rMWY_8U9Q,2007-07-20,V0EsJ8gw-NUFoiJcjcHb2Q,3,"Pomeroy's and I have a really ass backwards relationship. 

Typically, the purpose a bar serves me is to quench a thirst brought on by numerous factors, the most typical one being the uncanny excitement I have for making poor (but fun) decisions. Because of this, the purpose I serve bars is not only the obviously fiscal nature of the relationship, but I often serve as the harbinger of good times.

So here's the problem with P-roy's.

I never want to come here. Ever. This is the place I END UP at and it's typically the result of somebody else's negative circumstance that I don't really want to deal with (friend meltdown, death, crashed vehicles), and I almost always have to leave a place I like to come here. I know, weird, right?

Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course. 

We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isn't as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it.

The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didn't surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast.

It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isn't as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line.

*long sigh*

my newfound love of yogurtology has me feeling a little guilty, as if i've replaced an old love with a new one. such is life, i suppose.

the facts:

yogurtology has a wide range of excellent flavors of frozen yogurt that seem to rotate daily. i've seen chocolate mint, oreo, cupcake batter, red velvet, chocolate peanut butter, mango, blackberry, oatmeal cookie and vanilla bean, to name a few. each and every one delish. they also seem to always have at least one non-dairy option available...

the toppings are plentiful and varied. choose from fresh fruit, chopped candy bars, m&ms, nuts, baklava, brownies, truffles, cheesecake, sprinkles galore, ginormous marshmallows and gummy candy... i've never seen so many topping options in one place.

staff are very friendly and attentive. a little TOO attentive for my taste, but hey, i'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone unless i ask for help...overall, they rock!

loyalty punch-card? you betcha. so eat and eat and eat and score yourself some free yogurtology before starting the tasty process all over again.

She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). 

So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: 

1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html 

2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 

3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 

4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 

5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. 

Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. 

Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).

oFW8Fjszgsmy39a5hUnoBQ,2008-04-11,CQEOzdAPHNEbnxdgUzT32w,3,"I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. 

Getting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. 

Once I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. 

So far, so good.

But then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. 

Don't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. 

Having found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!

My first trip to the library was GREAT. 

Then the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some ""on hold"" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? 

This library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. 

I couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. 

So, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. 

So, let's recap:
*SLP has books!
*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)
*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. 
*You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.
*People working there are friendly.
*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. 
*It's not an easy place to browse.
*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.
*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.
*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. 
*There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! 
*You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. 
*It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.",review,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA,1,1,2

We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  

Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.

Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent.

The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.

I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so. 

Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.

I am not a margarita person AT ALL but my friend insisted I try their primarita (essentially a skinny margarita) and it was amazing. Probably what all margaritas are supposed to taste like. I crave them.

Their guacamole is phenomenal - fresh and made right in front of you to your taste. You really can't get any better without going to Mexico and eating at at a mom and pop restaurant. The pork shoulder is great and the skirt steak is to die for. This is also a great brunch spot - the green chile chilaquiles are outstanding. 

They are on the pricey end but their entrees are shareable. I love the dark, candlelit ambience. Perfect for pretty much any occasion: date night or bachelorette party. 

Cautions: it seems next to impossible to get a weekend dinner reservation between 6pm and 9:30pm. I don't know if these are blocked out by default on Open Table.

Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.

So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.  

The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.

Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.

Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-berto's, Baja Fresh, Rubio's etc.)

Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas' Mexican Food, etc.)

Type D: ""Mexican Denny's"" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevy's, El Torito, Macayo's, etc.) 

Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I don't know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.)

Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevy's or Macayo's.

The instructors are great!  They always take the time to say hello outside of class and they are very caring.  

The class ratio is fantastic - with a max of 3:1 in each beginner (Starfish) class.  

Currently the price is $72/month, which includes 1 class per week during the Spring and Summer and the ability to schedule unlimited classes per week from October-February.  The school also routinely sends emails for a free class when there is same day availability (usually with newer instructors).

I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.

I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.

I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.  

I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!  

On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""You're welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???  

I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.

Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. 

Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. 

As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. 

At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. 

They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch. 

For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night.",review,vQtiYv_KYj4ucNKv5iRfQA,0,0,0

a8yzGF79KcfyRye2R6wt3Q,2012-04-09,YV6DpBlgJqt7S5xucCdsjg,1,"Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.  

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on...",review,5W6WBEosZH2-atKjYDTVFw,3,2,2

He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie???

eTbtfgUtfewdncgVf2CbWw,2012-09-16,UIUfEDc62fpMxWCW3Lc5PQ,5,"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.

Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.

Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.

At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.

If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.

Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.",review,5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA,2,3,3
mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,2009-10-30,n9JTbyHVsl_awFDig-1Abw,5,"I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling. 

Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces. 

There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors. 

The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.

It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them",review,LhSKiNsXSItau9tgmRfzyw,1,3,1

I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons. 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)

Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.  
   Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.

I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.

My experience eating here was probably a lot like Shawn Johnson's experience at the games -- not quite the showing I expected, but GG still managed to eek out a medal or two.

My favorite Mongolian places include soup and salad bars in addition to the ingredients to be grilled; Genghis Grill does not. I missed being able to snack on a salad while waiting on my first bowl. 

The ingredients were all fine; most seemed fresh, but I had to avoid a couple of the less popular offereings (for the life of me, I don't understand why bok choy hasn't captured the hearts of the American public). The sauces were generally tasty...think Trader Joe's bottled dressings and you'll get the idea. 

The highlight of the night was when I realized the shredded cheese that given to me by request came free and clear. Of course, this made me wish I would have asked for sour cream, too. 

You won't see a picture of my experience at the Genghis Grill on a Wheaties box any time soon, but the meal was pleasant enough for a solid three stars.",review,z1c8uQv7tfgrP4-sVggbTA,4,2,3

Ruling: It's OK and a worthy stop in Scottsdale for a pre-dinner beverage. 

Sure, I could front load my review with spicy adjectives, overinflated superlatives, some forced humor, and throw on an added star and hope for a ROTD (come on, don't pretend that you don't know the formula), but I am not selling my stars for a day on the big screen. 

If it's been said once, twice, and even thrice, need I repeat it? Yes, because it is true -- this is not Postino, and for that matter, this is not Kaz. It is a good, local spot to grab a glass of wine, maybe even with your mom, who may not be hip enough to chill at Postino on Central (which really requires little hipness, I mean they let me in), or your dad, who may not be able to read in the dark at Kaz, or maybe for that friend from Gilbert, who you know, wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability. 

Predictability isn't bad...in this case, that means a good wine selection (could rotate more), full bar, usually one good draft or two out of 5, decent cocktails, and decent food. The food is not really what you come for. The bruschetta is sub par, but the salads are above par. And, I have to add, hummus with no flat bread or pita?? No. No pita for you! 

Service runs from friendly (read, management) to disillusioned and inattentive. The latter tends to happen if you sit outside. The last time I was in, I think grapes were crushed, olives were pressed, and chickpeas were ground...at least they could have been. 

Often they have live music too, which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the Motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near Elaine Benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing.",review,0NckJhx0qXykvvhsm-p7MA,2,3,2
ADJIoHN3uLx-JalYl3r3Dw,2012-07-24,kZsO87tYXkjCGZlrmwN-jw,4,"Talk about options!  It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu.

So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.  

The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.  

I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.

By The Rue

It's Friday night with nothing to do,
How about a show, maybe The Who,
Got in the Jeep,
Hit the street,
Drove out to Tempe,
And went to the Marquee.

Psychostick was the band I went to see,
They sing a funny song about boobies,
Tacos and Beer,
Both songs I did hear,
Watch out for the Narc,
Five dollars to park.

Fully stocked bar is good to know,
Go with friends, take home a ho,
Steal toed boots,
Dyed hair with roots,
Get into the pit,
Deck the guy who hits.

It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.  

Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative.

For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.",review,5-Gs3DpLZk6FjviyeXvR-A,2,3,2

The entertainment was great. Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.

km3g-wDO2KfhfnTvJrLJig,2011-02-24,v1EPSrG6zRUhd41Jt2ZTHA,3,"Last night after developing a huge craving for Panang Chicken and browsing Yelp for a good place nearby, I decided to call Papaya. The guy who answered the phone said that due to a downed gas line in the area they couldn't operate, but their Mesa store would deliver to me for no extra charge since I couldn't come pick it up like I wanted to. I said this would be fine, placed my order, and the guy said it would be about 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, but I figured it was just because it was coming from Mesa. 

When it finally arrived, I was starving, so I opened the food immediately, only to find out that my Panang CHICKEN was nothing but sauce and a few carrots and bell peppers. On top of this, I had been charged a delivery fee when they said I wouldn't, and I was charged for chicken when I got none. I called back immediately to tell them my food did not have any chicken in it, but was only sauce and a couple vegetables. They informed me that they were very busy and would not be able to bring me another order that night, but I could call back the next day (today) and they would bring me another order. I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good. Well, it was. The panang sauce was very delicious and perfectly spicy. Although it was not made the way I ordered it, I could still tell that it was very good and I would definitely order it again. 

Today, I called back and they brought me a new order, this time of Spicy Eggplant with chicken since I had already had to eat the panang I ended up with last night and didn't want that again at this point. They were very nice about making it right, and they delivered it to me again at no charge and credited back the charge they made last night. Delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes again even though he had said 45 and this location is about a mile from where I live, so if you order delivery expect a bit of a wait. As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, it was REALLY delicious. The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had, not mushy but not firm, and I finally got my chicken and yes, it was very good. SO in conclusion, the food is great but I hope that they are more organized when they aren't having technical difficulties. Probably won't have them deliver again but I would definitely order from here again. If there hadn't been all the problems I would give them 4 stars but the fact that I couldn't even get my order corrected that night was upsetting.",review,1uwqR1r9nMDgI6RZT_bL2w,0,0,0
