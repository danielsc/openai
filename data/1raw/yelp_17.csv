However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!

When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.

Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.

--hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice
--crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab
--tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting
--side salad for ciabatta ""sandwich"" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame!
--chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese

Now, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist!

1. The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. 
2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. 
3. The massage was pretty weak. 
4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. 
5. It was difficult to make an appointment here. I had to call several times and leave messages and wait for them to call me back.

Xq9tkiHhyN_aBFswFeGLvA,2011-03-21,cVDmpkto6Fs-LwCkxKPx3g,2,"I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.

First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.

Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.

Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.

Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   

Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.
No value

Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.
My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.

Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.

Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less!

I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.

The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. 

So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. 

The waiter:

* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.
* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...""oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano."" Bonus points for knowing that.

Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. 

All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot.

I went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion, and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around. We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.

Last year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.

It probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.

The salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.

This is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.

The portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.

I'm giving this place 3 stars b/c it's a good value if you're sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating.",review,jt8jtEY1K6TD1FBzYa7HGw,0,2,2,17

The menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement.

Bathroom was nice, you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos, they're in the wall mounted containers, which is nice.
Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board, but other than that, the room was perfect, especially if you like hip, modern decor, which I do.  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA, but not quite as roomy.  The rest of the property was just OK, yes, they have a lounge, but need a restaurant.

I had the house enchiladas with grilled chicken and that was delicious.  The rice and beans left something to be desired.  Husband had the pork green chile mac and cheese which he enjoyed but felt was underseasoned.    

I ordered the peach sangria on the recommendation of a friend but found it to be too wine-y for me.  I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for the passionfruit sangria which I enjoyed much more.  I also tried the blood orange mojito and the coconut mojito.  They were both fabulous and LARGE!  If it were up to me, I'd make them slightly less sweet but they were still fantastic nonetheless.

My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes.

We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:

Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.

Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small
in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.

Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.

recommended Food:
Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.
Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.
Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.
Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.
Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.
Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.

Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.

When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  

There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.

There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.

Things I only liked:
The Pork Kwediaw Kraphrao (mint and pepper stir fry with egg noodles) was not as mediumly spiced and could have used a touch more mintyness. They were out of Pumpkin Custard, which made me very sad as it sounded awesome.

I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since. 

I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the ""basic"" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise.",review,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ,10,13,6,17

I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.

In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.

The crowd here varies but I have always felt welcome.  Drinks are ok.  Sometimes they're great but it depends on who's tending bar.  The good thing is they're fairly cheap.  As a music venue I give it  high five.  It's dirty and dark with a one foot high stage that's obviously meant for performance but not so far removed as to make you feel like you're not connected to what's going on.  The sound is ok.  It depends on the show really but I've always had a good time and that counts for a lot.

I like the pictures on the ceiling. They're fun to try to decipher when you're setting yourself on spin cycle.

The 'Cuisine of New Mexico' is unique... they are known for their green chile potato as well as several other pork dishes.  I usually go for the fish or seafood specials... they have a standard menu and then specials posted on chalk boards around the restaurant.

Most recently I enjoyed the blackened scallop appetizer as my entree along with a huge house salad.  The scallops were a little bit salty but cooked just right.  They were served on a tortilla with rice, beans, and a yummy spicy sauce.  Their salads are really tasty, and many of the entree specials come with a starter salad.  I went with a group of 4 and we had a couple of bottles of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer to share.  Needless to say, none of us had room for dessert!

Be prepared for a crowd whenever you go, but enjoy your company and the people around you.

Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.

I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.

The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.

In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.

I've been riding this system on and off (I vaccilate between non-Phoenix-metro cities and here a lot) for roughly 10 years, and yeah, for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there, so I have a sound basis of comparison. 

This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations. Hell, in NYC and LA, it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated. Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other city-size comparable mass transit system that's out there. Get with the times!

I wouldn't spend my money to stay here ever again.  The hotel itself looks nice.  It's large, spacious and the bar by the lobby is impressive.

But the rooms...Well I feel as if they're nothing special and the heavenly beds were not as heavenly as I had imagined.

The pool service was awful as well.  The managers don't know what they're doing and the pool is always overstaffed with lazy high school kids or severely understaffed with one or two servers for the entire pool area.

For the price, I'd go stay at the Four Seasons, where they actually know what good customer service is.",review,0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q,2,3,1,17

My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!

He also said I could either use the Coke machine or the iced tea dispensers. He had two kinds of iced tea, regular and a green blackberry. I took a little bit of the green blackberry which was very refreshing and tasted pretty good. I then went over to the Coke machine to get that. The sign on the Coke machine basically said once you buy a cup, you can refill it again and again the same day of purchase. I'll remember this if I ever have a layover in Phoenix.

The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple ""I'll be back with your orders."" When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back.

We've talked about this place for a while, and I'll be damned if I was leaving AZ before stopping by this place!  So luckily, I was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries.

We got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd.  We were the only white girls, so we know we were in for a good meal.  Going over the menu took us a while, because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted, and the server was polite enough to let us take our time.

Before we figured out what we wanted for dinner, of course we had to figure out drinks.  So we all order and still continue to peruse the menu.  Then our drinks came out...huge plus for this place right here, they were huge!  My gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend's Chardonnay was filled to the brim.  No skimping on alcohol here!  The waiter advised us the drinks were strong, which I was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down.

We finally end up decided on dinner, with the shahih paneer, chicken saag, and vegetable korma, and an order of garlic naan.  I was a little unsure about the paneer, but my girlfriends swore by it.

When the food arrived, we were excited!  Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge, good thing we only got one order.  I loved every single bite I had at dinner, and the feeling was mutual across the table.  All of us ate beyond the point of feeling full, but we couldn't help ourselves!  This food was too good!

Luckily, we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home.  I got the chicken saag and I am so excited to have some for my own brunch.  Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry thinking about it now.

Taco Felix is a godsend for anyone who falls into one or more of the above categories. It provides decent and affordably-priced Mexican food 24 hours a day and best of all, it has a drive-through. 

My husband and I tried this place for the first time for lunch today. We went at a standard time of day because this place is just a few blocks from us and we wanted to see if it was decent before we tried it out one night after midnight after karaoking it up at Silver Pony (just a block or so away). We ordered 4-5 different items - rolled tacos, bean tostada, carne asada taco, quesadilla supreme, and a chile relleno - and a large soda, and it only came out to $12! As a side note, the credit card receipt didn't provide a space to leave a tip, so you should bring a few bucks to thank the employee working for their efforts. 

The only major downside was that it took quite a while for our food to come, since the drive-through was hopping (lots of people getting menudo after a crazy Friday night, I'm assuming) and there were only 2 chefs and one server (who had to take and serve both drive-through and eat-in orders). However, the food was definitely decent and the portions really sizable, and we felt that it was a great value for our money. Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices, we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight, to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed, or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks.",review,HOleI3jz1MLNUJ6cc1x0Pw,2,3,2,17

The food has been hot, tastes fresh, excellent presentation and absolutely delicious.  Portions, in my opinion, are definitely a good portion---just right.  Entree is served with white rice, soup/broth, and a tasty shredded side salad with a great Asian dressing.  

Staff was polite and attentive, food came out in a timely manner.  Have thoroughly enjoyed my experience each time.   They play nice ""Global Ambient"" music, the restaurant is somewhat small yet cozy.  It has a nice ""grown up"" simple Asian feel.

I know....a busy Saturday night and so, perhaps I should give both the servers and chef a break? Sorry. The menu has changed and so has the quality of food - and not in a good way. Let me just give you a brief sample of our experience - the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors. The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce. It actually made me ill to eat it - and my companion, as well. 

Our service was slow and unattentive - although I do realize service can be a very personal experience. 

I was sick with food poisoning all day Sunday - as if the poorly prepared food were not enough to bring down my joy. 

So, I caution those of you who may have once enjoyed this restaurant like me - think twice before dropping a pretty penny at Wildfish.",review,IibG_Dl9P24zExWisTEvMg,0,1,0,17

This is often called the largest mall in Arizona, and it shows. Each time I've done the usual ""mall walk"" I've easily lost a few hours trying to see it all. It's true that this isn't a place for anyone that doesn't care about fashion - but this is a mall that's true to its name. ""Fashion Center"" is no joke here. Lots of high-end designer stores, lots of mid-range affordable fashion stores, and a few random familiar stops like Hallmark and Pottery Barn-esque stores scattered through there. A decent food court, with a theater also conveniently down there. (But after spending so many hours at the mall, who has time for a movie?)

You can easily drop a few thousand here, so be forewarned if you're on a budget. Also, I almost wish I had a map in my pocket, because it can get confusing to remember which hallways you've already explored. And wear some comfortable walking shoes, because it's not easy to get in and get out of this one. But there's a good number of parking to use in a garage or few - when you remember where you parked the car. 

I'd take any out-of-towner here, unless they had a grudge against fashion, classy stores, or walking.",review,cq2Vu3g1auTQ4nlNOVjegA,1,1,1,17

Went over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.

Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre. 
Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now. 
Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff. 

If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk.",review,PV5Lv_xl3DDAcAchFJCbXQ,0,0,0,17

We decided we wanted another pizza and when we asked our server for another, we were told that we could not because there was a line of people waiting to get in.  I was amazed.  We left knowing we would NEVER go back.  I heard about La Piazza al Forno not long after that experience.....I truly believe things happen for a reason.  The pizza was even better and has been consistant ever since.  The service was very warm and friendly, literally like a family welcoming me into their home.  I learned that night, that it was one big family run business.  Oh and by the way, the best...did I say BEST pizza that I not only have had in AZ, but NY has nothing over them!

4sW8Z6NLXLRkruSKSKUEUw,2008-11-04,_TiNhzf2OAmLMKSipt1Qaw,3,"Hob Nob's Coffee House and Gourmet Deli is what has emerged from the dust and smoke that once was the Willo House (one ""w"", not two). Willo House was a Phoenix landmark beloved by many for its tremendous coffee, well-worn couches, and memories of Mary McCann's Poetry Slams--and loathed by others for its unmistakable smoke stench and vocally hung-over clientele.  So, like many CenPhos, I felt saddened  when I saw the ""closed"" sign hung on Willo's door earlier this year, and I've been watching for this coffee interloper to open its doors. I've been hopeful that we'd find a new funky midtown establishment to add to Phoenix's growing reputation for goodness. 

Feeling emboldened and optimistic after voting on November 4th, Baby Oli and I stopped into Hob Nob's for a morning caffeine treat.  
Let me begin by saying, holy moley, they got the smell of smoke out! I thought for sure that the odor of cloves and American Spirit would have permanently saturated the building's core.  In fact, there was not much at all inside to remind me of the Willo-that-was. They've knocked down walls to widen the space inside and painted in warm hues . The place now has what you might call ""a décor."" They said good-bye to funky and eclectic, and hello...hmm... Pottery Barn? 

I ordered an iced chai tea and a chocolate pastry. The chai was a chai, and the pastry was yummy, but not OMG-eat-here-this-instant yummy. The sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and ""the finest long line caught Albacore tuna center cut all white meat.""  They also have some pretty impressive looking hand-made chocolates.

I'm not going to lie, I do miss the old, lovingly run-down, Willo style. Hob Nob's felt a little too Scottsdale to me. I may be 100% wrong on this, but I don't think the owners of Hob Nob's are Phoenicians. The man who made my Chai had clearly never been to--or maybe even heard of--the original Willo, and wasn't interested in any jovial chit chat about the old locale, they spelled ""Willo House"" incorrectly on their take-away menu, and the place simply doesn't have that Phoenix feel. 

Regardless of the Scottsdale vibe, I will go back to try those sandwiches, or maybe to test out their springy couches and fire place while grading essays. I'd love to toss them one more star!

The salad bar is so old school, it still has jello - not jello shots - jello.  And since, I'm old school, I'm a fan of the salad bar.

Monday 4 buck burgers with 2.50 salad bar is the only food you'll require for the whole day.  Decent burger too.

Good barkeeps - they remember your name or call you hon (old school).

The food is pretty basic, but they start with decent ingredients and prepare them well.  Had the prime rib a couple of weeks ago and my view is that the only way to eat prime rib is to have it breath it's last on the way from the kitchen to the table.  It was early enough in the evening that they were able to deliver a tasty hunk of meat that was as requested.

Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesn't mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva!

It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didn't work for me. It felt like I was in someone's basement turned rocker's haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump. 

The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-21 crowd from the over-21 boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-21 side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldn't the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues I've been to.  That's a plus.  

Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down!

Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As ""pedalers"" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!

We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait. 

As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted ""non pedaling"" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system. 

Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have ""that guy"" in our group. 

If you're saying to yourself,  ""Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg"" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.

But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!

At present, it leaves something to be desired, but we're starved for a place to shop on this side of town that has local and/or natural foods, so something is better than nothing! Also, I have faith that they will expand the available goods as time goes on. I'm excited to see how it develops.

The good:  Great bread! This is the best part of this place thus far. The breads are fresh daily, baked locally, CHEAP ($1.79 per loaf for white, wheat, rye, marble ryle, onion, etc...), and all natural. And most importantly, they taste really good.  Picking up a loaf of the onion rye has already become a weekly ritual for me. They also have specialty pastries, tortillas, etc. Though I haven't tried those yet, they look good, and the prices are also very reasonable.

The produce is also good. It's not a huge selection, but the prices are fair and the quality seems good. It's great to have locally grown items available nearby.

Everyone who works there is super friendly, which is great, and they seem to be open long hours, which is really convenient.

The down-side: As I said, very limited selection. The dry goods vary between local (mostly) and mass-produced (some random items). Some of the local artisan products look great, but they're very expensive. I think they'd be a little cheaper at an actual farmers' market (ie, where we're buying direct from the producer)--but I do plan to save up so I can try the pasta, etc.

Weirdly, this place rounds out its selection of local/natural stuff with mass-produced crappy candy, ice cream bars, toilet paper, etc. I can't help but wish they'd found some greener alternatives. (Also-- Fiji Water? Come on, guys... That company is TERRIBLE. And the opposite of local. I don't get why they carry it.)

Overall it was fresh and well-presented and halfway between actually authentic Japanese and some American Asian fusion food. The bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders weren't really fabulous in any way. Same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general.

My husband refused to let it go and finished it over the course of our meal!

On this, our first trip, we had Tangerine Beef and the Crispy duck.  The tangerine beef sauce was sweet and a bit tangy with a touch of spice and the beef was crispy and very tasty.  The duck was amazing.  The tastes were multilayered and well balanced and the crispy coating was salty and peppery and almost buttery under it all.  Together it created a very complex savory and sweet dish with a kick of spice at the tail end.  The flavors in the duck were very reminiscent of Cantonese food in Shanghai...this is the first time I can say this about a restaurant in the states that isn't located in a Chinatown.

I think I've been too spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco, since the food selection here was more limited and there wasn't as many booths to buy things from.  I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.

The restaurant was not crowded yet we were sat at one of the few tables without a view.  My biggest problem was the flies.  They were everywhere and we were seated INSIDE the restaurant not on the patio.  When you go to an up-scale restaurant to celebrate a special occassion, who wants to be shooing flies away from their food.  It was really disgusting and distracting.

In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously 'The Counter') and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating.

Future yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloe's Corner a high end restaurant... it's more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  It's the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when it's ready.  It's also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go...

We both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other 'classic' items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc...

Even more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  I'm so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be!

That said, the food here is not too bad.  For lunch, it's a decently priced meal for a lot of grub.

I got the Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls and the Pho (which they call Beef Noodles I believe).  

My first impression unfortunately when the app came out was that the Spring Rolls used iceberg lettuce instead of basil or mint or a more dark green leafy green.  The iceberg lettuce gave the Spring Rolls a cheaper feel that I didn't really enjoy.

The Pho was better though they seemed quite stingy on the accoutrement, as I got two jalapeno slices and a sorry looking stem of basil.  In addition, the thin slices of beef were definitely overcooked and tasted not unlike a sponge.

Formerly known as Daily Buffet,  http://www.yelp.com/biz/daily-buffet-phoenix#hrid:3-lmRTZ9YDgPxf6I2WGfHA  they offer an extensive menu.  Whatever investment they're making in this new branding, their menu certainly looks impressive.(pic)

Their buffet is quite well-stocked for it's small size.
Whether you prefer Chinese or Spanish fried rice, they have it.  Have a few picky kids that can't decide between Honey Sesame chicken and Cheese Enchiladas?  They've got you covered.

The Mexican buffet table offers rice, beans, enchiladas, taquitos, and other rotating entrees such as marinated pork ribs or a scrumptious chicken mole, if you're lucky that day.
The Chinese area includes lots of chicken and pork options, noodles, egg foo young, etc  --  standard americhino fare.  The pork ribs were very good, if a little chewy, and the sweet & sour pork was done in the style I prefer: Instead of breaded, dry peices that you put your own sauce on, or soupy watery liquid with floating veggies and meat, this had mostly meat, maybe a few carrot and onion peices, with a crispy outside covered in thick, gooey, sticky sauce, that itself got a little crispy.  (it almost starts to remind me of a candy apple when it gets like this, which I'm sure the taste buds love, but the teeth hate!)

All is prepared well, hot, not too salty or greasy, and well replenished.
Discard Pile is usually present, but also usually small.
There were some hand-breaded onion rings that were super thick!  This thing was the size of a small donut in my hand! (pic) They have a perfectly crisped outside, with an inside akin to a hushpuppy or donut.

Mmmm, ""donionuts""....

The salad bar area left a little to be desired, and there wasn't really a salsa to dip my taquitos in.  I made a nice little concoction of ketchup, pico de gallo, and sriracha sauce which suited the task way better than I could have ever thought.
Jello squares are the only real dessert option, but if you haven't stuffed yourself full of this yummy indulgent food by that point, you really don't belong in a boofay now, do you?",review,n_lAaNGeWgspbbCJc0DqRg,7,11,7,17

The villa had it's own kitchen fully equipped with a fridge, stove, sink and even had cups and glasses. There was a little seating area by the kitchen as well.

The bedrooms were both a good size and the master bedroom had a huuuuuge bathroom. It also had his and her's sink and tons of space. I was sad that I didn't get to use the shower because it was a walk-in shower and was spacious.

There was also a larger sitting area with a tv and fireplace and it also had a pull out bed from the couch. I recommend getting a villa if you will be sharing the space with a few people as there is tons of room!

To get to the block party we were going to, we called taxis and the Hilton also sent over shuttles to get us to and from. They weren't charging but did ask for tips. They were really easy to communicate with since we had so many people and they did an awesome job!

My only complaint is that some of the outlets in the bathroom and the room didn't work. It wasn't too big of a deal since I found one that worked that was luckily by a mirror so I could do my hair, haha.

One of my favorites is Indian food, and thanks to Microsoft and other tech companies, who use workers from India,  there are many more Indian restaurants now scattered throughout the country.  I am not an expert on the food (in fact, until recently, I never understood why Bollywood movies were always playing in Indian restaurants).  But I do enjoy it, and try every Indian restaurant I can find.

I started going to Indian Paradise several years ago, and loved it.  It has a nice interior, and the servers are very nice and helpful.  I always seem to come in the early evening, before they are busy, and I always feel somewhat spoiled the way they treat me.  I love their masalas, curry, and naan, and have, of course, tried all of their Indian beers. I also find the different tandoori dishes delicious.

I might note that I have never made it to the lunch buffet - I always seem to be golfing at that time so I'm just never in the area .  But it is on my list of things to do.

***Bollywood - Bollywood is the name given to the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry in India.The term Bollywood was created by conflating Bombay (the city now called Mumbai) and Hollywood. Bollywood films are usually musicals. Few movies are made without at least one song-and-dance number.

Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon.

Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'
After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.'

I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their ""grand opening"" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.

Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I'm weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn't get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I'm just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.

My next complaint is the selection.  I'm not even going to complain that you don't have basic things like fruit or butter.  I'm going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.

Finally, what's with the ""wine bar""?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?  It really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich/wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries.

That's the Trojan Battle Cry!""
Wow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV. 
 My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.
  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. 
Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.
 They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. 
 They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. 
 I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase ""come out of the closet"" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie ""Pump Up the Volume"", which was filmed in the general area.
  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. 
 I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that ""The slaves did not have it so bad"".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. ""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.""  
 
The Good Things I Remember -
 Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza.

When you go in you pay for either a small bowl ($9) or a large bowl ($10). I got the small bowl and still had enough left over for another meal. 

The ingredients are spread out in a buffet. You go along the buffet and fill your bowl with whatever you like. I chose chicken, lots of veggies and rice noodles. The trick, from what I can tell is to shove as much food in your bowl and then using the handy wax paper they leave out for you, smash it down into your bowl so you can fit even more in! At the end of the buffet are tubs of different sauces and a chalkboard with  instructions for different combinations. I am a bit of a traditionalist and mixed up the Mongolian sauce. You then hand your embarrassingly heaping bowl to the cooks who quickly stir fry it for you and then hand it back.

Can I just say oh my God was this delicious without sounding vain because really I sort of cooked it myself? The ingredients were super fresh!  There is also a small bar with soup and rice, but I wouldn't waste my time with those if I were you! The BBQ was delicious and fun to prepare!",review,Y5Bu0M1AZzre9CjdlnQNYQ,0,1,1,17

I saw the Simpsons movie here tonight and just have a few thoughts to share.

-The Cine Capri screen is big.  Anyone who has visited either the Scottsdale location or now-defunct Camelback relic knows this, but I felt it was worth repeating.  Very cool to see a movie on a screen larger than life itself.

-There is always ""that guy"" in the theater.  You know, the one that laughs as loud as a bullhorn, repeats everything that happens on-screen, and occasionally yells out something profane or derogatory.  Now, imagine a theater where every guy is ""that guy.""  If it weren't for the cool factor of the huge screen and seeing a movie I've been waiting to see since childhood, I would have walked out in annoyance.  Seriously, what compels people to behave like this?  I don't know if this is due to the proximity to ASU (beefneck central), but it sucked.

HOWEVER-- be not dissuaded by the dirt on my bumper (as I wiped it off, and the rest of the car looked great) because the vacuums at this place? OH MY GOSH!

Word to the wise: when you go to remove the hoses from their little canisters, pull with force.

They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.  The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card.

They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.  They also will give cookies to children.

So, unless your planning on cooking with your fresh items that day, I would avoid the produce and even some dairy and meat items. So what I am saying is, frozen, dry or canned stuff...I am pretty sure your safe with.

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of ""Daddy Long Legs,"" ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!

WNy1uzcmm_UHmTyR--o5IA,2012-07-10,uWOai947MVYIhiQGstsdhQ,5,"Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. 

If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. 

Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. 

I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites. 

Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.

If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.

No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.

We both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus. 

The pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. 

But let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us.

They also have some interesting things on the menu you I am excited to try next time I stop in; deviled eggs, olive oil cake, and their mac 'n cheese.

Their wine list was nice, decently priced as well. Radio Milano has a warm cozy inviting feel, anyone can have a good time.

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children.

I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  

My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal...

This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time. 
My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me. 
I would definitely recommend it for a Sunday fun day. I didn't feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a Saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained.",review,liiYhDAP64C8uLyixBDWdg,0,3,1,17

39 cents for a balanced taco with a decent amount of cheese and delicious medium (""Scorcho"") sauce --- THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. Plus the deluxe tacos are CHOCK FULL. I usually get 4 regular tacos and end with 2 deluxe ones.
I've had the double cheeseburger once, nothing impressive there. It wants to be an In 'n' Out Double-Double, but it falls short, like when you were a kid and wanted Levi's 505's for Christmas and end up getting Sears jeans.

We stayed in the 9000 section of the hotel which is behind the convention center part.  I'd recommend this if you want something quiet where you won't get noise from the front parking area or pools.  Yes, I said pools...a great thing for those of us who only wanted to relax and get some sun.
Every staff member that we encountered walking the property was friendly and always acknowledged us.  
We had a two queen room and the room itself was very large and I liked that every room has either a patio or balcony.  Our view happened to be of the basketball and tennis court but it was nice to be able to go outside and sit on the patio in the morning to have coffee and relax.  I assume that we had a room that had already been renovated since the bedding looked new...and the bed was SO comfortable!  
The breakfast buffet is good and it's nice that you can order eggs anyway you like them as part of that.  Other than that we mostly just had drinks while laying by the pool.  

The only negative thing that comes to mind is the fact that the toilets are VERY loud when flushed.  I have no idea if it was the rooms next to us or above us but every time someone flushed a toilet in the middle of the night I woke up....I am a light sleeper but still, if there are more renovations to be done I hope this is something they can address.

All the little details in the decor, like placing the chopsticks on a polished river rock was beautiful. Their menu offered everything from chicken and beef to lots of seafood. I ordered chicken teriyaki and it was delish. Their sauce tasted homemade and was lighter then most which I loved. It came plated nicely. I also had their tempura which was light and airy as it should be. The dipping sauce, also heavenly. My man seemed to enjoy his sushi and it looked nice as well.

HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!",review,4dnDsoHuxUtzhaumxbpR5w,1,6,5,17

Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at 5 foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience.

Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, they're all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream.",review,OQMOgqS1NFIyAW4i66iDYA,0,0,0,17

This location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They've only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  It's also easy to find once you're off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... it's on the right and shares parking with Gold's Gym that is easily seen from the road.

I found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.

Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of ""ham that falls off the bone"" was repeated far too many times.

Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so I'll be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family.",review,joIzw_aUiNvBTuGoytrH7g,2,7,1,17

The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.  
The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!  
The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.",review,beKlmyoDlGIMI4It65QX9w,0,1,0,17

What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?

Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!

In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.

After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.",review,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw,8,11,3,17

In 2008, I came with some friends who bought a $6 hamburger at one of the tents, took one bite, and threw it in the trash. One of them remarked later that it was the only time in his life he'd spit food out in disgust. While this was happening, another friend and I asked a toothless Vietnam veteran manning another tent where we could find the nearest restroom. His reaction suggested that we were insane for asking such a ridiculous question; we surmised that perhaps, due to some bizarre war injury, he had not taken a piss since 1973.

 After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm.

We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasn't for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldn't be so subtle next time. 

The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didn't frequent the games I would've walked out. Probably wouldn't notice.

I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one ""great"" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!?

I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat!

No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like ""Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold."")

Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home.

This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night. 

I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.

I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far.

We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.

Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the ""town"" and taking goofy pictures of each other.

Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.

A lot more casual than I was expecting, but not necessarily in a bad way; I just assumed that being voted into the top 5 restaurants in the city, the place would have a touch more snooty-factor.  Kinda like an upscale, family restaurant if that makes sense.

I started with the creamy grits and schreiner's sausage trio.  I have to say it was my first time for grits.  Solid dish, I may prefer polenta to grits, but this dish was done really well.  Wife went with the brussel sprouts.  Very tasty, but strange to see as an appy - thought it might be more of a side.  Seeing as they're not on the menu anymore, it doesn't matter.

Mains: I had the Short Ribs and my broad had the Cast Iron Chicken.  I was blown away with the short ribs - they were indeed fork tender, as I didn't lift my knife once for this plate.  Great flavourful mash with the red wine reduction.  Truly a great dish.  Wife's chicken was great as well.  Smoky, tender chicken with the incredible stuffing.

Bacon cheddar biscuits were ordered, but we had to take them home as we were both stuffed.  A little dry, but good the next day, however.

Service was rushed in the beginning, as our waiter asked how are meals were, but was gone before I could answer.  He was in the weeds though as it was hella busy for a while.  He made up for it later in the meal.

Dessert: wife had Nutella pudding and it was adequate. The coffee creme brule on the other hand was outstanding.  Thick and rich, and packed of caffeine.  Good finish.  Oh, and good cocktail menu too.

We shared a large chicken cheesesteak with everything (onions, bell peppers), and cheese wiz, along with some sweet potato fries.

The chicken cheesesteak came with a good amount of tender chicken, with a lot of flavor.  There is a free-range mini fridge that is stocked with sweet , hot peppers, and fry sauce which is nice so you can customize your order with as many or as little peppers as you want.  While the ingredients were good quality, the cheesesteak as a whole naturally doesn't really compare to any I've had in Philly, but it's good for Arizona!

The sweet potato fries were my favorite part of the meal.  They tasted freshly cut, and were excellently cooked with just the right amount of crunch while still tender and sweet inside.

About the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.

Now about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.

Now for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.

The second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).

Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!",review,Iv7fQNT5LrrJcDx8AbNkXA,0,2,0,17

It is much more of a consignment store. Most of the things are new (or lightly worn) and are cheaper than retail prices but more expensive than Goodwill. The selection really isn't bad. I have found a few things here I am really happy with. 

Example: A sweet pair of orange high heels from Steve Madden I think. (I don't really give a crap about brand names, I buy things because I like em, no matter the name). They were thirty bones (not too cheap) but probably a lot less than they would have been at the mall (I am guessing, 60?).

Its still a fun store despite the vintage confusion. Everyone who works there I think gets all the good clothes first because they are always so freakin' adorable! Super friendly (not the fake kind either, can you believe someone is f*cking the handshake in this metropolis?).

The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast.

We had a reservation for 8PM for 4 of us, and at 730PM Andrea asked us to add 2 guests and when Dottsy called Metro they said of course, but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table. Which leads me to the only bad point of the evening:

We had to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for our larger table. We had all expected and accepted a 30 minute wait. After about 40 we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters (otter creeks = yummmm).  After an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group, I approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab, which was incredibly nice. 

When we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes. Hello!  We were all starving and got right to the point with our orders: I started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me. A cold soup, this is made with cucumbers, buttermilk, dill and olive oil, with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top, because why the hell not?!  Also, the soup came in a really large bowl and I was full by the time I finished it. I did soldier on to my main course which was the Moules Frites which is what I had the first time I came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels, and a broth with thyme, garlic and perhaps a little white wine. Then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didn't leave oil on my hands. 

Sadly I had to leave some of those friends behind, but only because it was time for dessert! I chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche. I requested a brioche-free pot and it was no problem. I was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup/creme and three slices of caramelized banana. It was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar. 

I will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours (we left at 11:30PM) making this the longest I ever spent in a restaurant (3.5 hours are you kidding me?) which is why I ultimately docked one star. Based on food alone Metro Brasserie deserves 10 stars.",review,PoQOIZc2q5nud7uVz_jdjw,2,4,1,17

I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ,2010-11-18,Za3DdMX65Bav0fU4-QrNGA,4,"4.5 Stars... I really enjoyed Beckett's table! It's a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard they're planning to build a large patio on the side of the building. 

I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items: 

The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing! 

We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste. 

The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside. 

The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friend's short rib - very tender and lean. 

We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now. 

Overall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion.",review,oy6fdscGSXY2gzRqF9pZxg,3,4,2,17
EcHuaHD9IcoPEWNsU8vDTw,2010-12-08,Ko6o7BA0EdlGBlFtJ5fbxg,4,"Having just returned from a whirlwind overseas business trip, Condor had to unwind. No place better than the Spa at Camelback Inn. It has been years since Condor visited and, as I expected, they did not recall that on my last visit I mistakenly thought the terrycloth robe and slippers were a gift.  The letters demanding their return stopped after 3 months.

Arriving in the lobby I was greeted by the soothing sound of Asian Zen music and the tranquil flow of fountain water. After a quick flashback to the three days in a jungle hut cell due to a jade sale gone bad, I headed to the luxurious locker, donned the fluffy terrycloth robe and settled poolside. 

My first disappointment of not having a drink in hand almost immediately was soothed when staff opened the bar 2 hours early. Talk about customer service at 7:30 in the morning. Having the secluded pool to myself, literally, I settled in to a literary vacation of the mind. It had been a long time since I read ""US Weekly"". 

Engrossed in the torrid life experiences of the hoi polli, I hardly noticed Companion had arrived and asked why I had already consumed six umbrella laden cocktails. ""The heat,"" I responded. ""It's 75 degrees,"" Companion stated with the accuracy of a former weekend weather girl in San Diego. 

Well, more cocktails ensued, including Companion's Mango Margarita, whose orange color I compared to the stunning, skin tight dress worn by an unknown actress named ""Roxie"" at a Red Carpet Event in the pages of ""US Weekly"". The color of the Mango Margarita complimented  the snow white of my robe after it was hurled in my direction. 

Another drink soothed Companion's ire and it was time for the highlight of the day: our individual Swedish Massages! Escorted by my Massage Therapist, the spitting image of Peta Wilson (Google it.) I was soon transported into a realm of relaxation and bliss. The bad news came when I was awaken from my trance by a knock on the door. It seems my snoring had disturbed the guests next door and my session was cut short. 

No matter, more poolside time with Companion awaited and more frothy cocktails. Unfortunately, upon return to my chaise lounge, I was greeted with a note. Apparently Companion and her Male Masseur hit it off and were enjoying cocktails at the Valley Ho Hotel down the street. I was definitely not invited. 

Well, upon reflection, the facility, service, therapist and massage were excellent. Although romance did not blossom, I did add another terrycloth robe to my closet, albeit with a Mango Margarita stain.",review,i8kR-Qnn3xd9EnpCWs9POQ,0,0,1,17
d3MxUXS1b6U2P_gGuCO1-A,2010-05-09,9jIhtPqtWjP7EOPxv_DQeQ,5,"I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed. I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombra's last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night. 

Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably don't even know about yet. 

I tried three top-notch items:

Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren't careful. Don't skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first. 

White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, it's one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, it's a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!)

The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. It's nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. I've always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. There's nothing to hide behind, and you're confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering.

The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone.",review,Xiprzd4TvJcZnVHGPdDh1A,1,0,0,17

Always amazing customer service and it's great that they let you taste everything before you commit. 

They should lighten their footprint and reduce food packaging. I always feel guilty when I leave with all that aluminum and styrofoam.

BTW, don't be swayed by offers of other cookies; snickerdoodles are where it's at.",review,PNAkqna65eJq8Od5dl1iDA,2,3,1,17

BAD CALL! Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it. If I wasn't locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now.

Internet: I signed up for their ""Heavy Duty"" internet @ 20 Mbps. I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com. The best I have ever seen is a little over 5. When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds. That is why they advertise ""up to"" 20 Mbps...

Phone: Extremely poor sound quality, very loud static and crackling, shocking as this is what they should be good at. I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it. This was the day after install!! Helpful hint, call back and tell them you want to cancel your account. The customer loyalty group is actually decent, they sent out a tech free of charge. He fixed it after a couple of hours, but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line...

The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...  I went with a bundled package (phone, cable, internet). The plan I signed up for was $147 a month. The first bill was $147, the second bill in I'm at $272.43. I can't make any sense out of the bill so I'm not sure why they think i owe this much. I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools. 

The day this contract is up I'm going back to Cox and I'll be happy to pay more!!",review,hh8ZFVvVMKNhbc5oM7SJWQ,0,0,0,17
