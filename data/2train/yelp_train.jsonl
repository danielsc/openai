{"prompt":"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. \n\nLoved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. \n\nInside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of \"Dusk Till Dawn\". \n\nWe were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? \nWe weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. \n\nAnyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) \nThere is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.\n\nFor $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. \nThere was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. \n\nMy Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.\n\nI'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3"}

{"prompt":"I'm 2 weeks new to Phoenix. I looked up Irish bars in town and found Rosie's. The decor and ambience was outstanding. I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! \n\nThe basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.\n\n\nAll the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming. I am sure I will see a bunch (or all) of them again and I look forward to that!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4"}
{"prompt":"Not that my review will mean much given the more in-depth reviewers but I will chime in nonetheless...\n\nI can really only review one dish, the #3 lunch special, Yellow Curry Chicken. I don't know what the authentic name for it is, Kang Karee something or other. It's so tasty that the first time I had it I knew I'd never branch out. Good lunch spot if you work around downtown. Not the quickest service all the time and can get busy during lunch, but always consistently good. Fairly dim inside, a good place to forget about the sun on a summer day.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4"}
{"prompt":"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying \"x large pizza and large salad only 23$\". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. \n\nTo the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. \n\nAnd your salads are severely overpriced \n\nWon't go back unless I'm desperate.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2"}
{"prompt":"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight.

{"prompt":"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.\n\nThat being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.\n\nI should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5"}
{"prompt":"Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5"}
{"prompt":"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.\n\nThis cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!\n\nIt looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!\n\nAs if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5"}
{"prompt":"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4"}

{"prompt":"They've gotten better and better for me in the time since this review was written. \n\nMy last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one.\n\nI think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started. It still tends to suck if you aren't Ascent club (like just about any budget-centric airline does), but once you get there it's a good value. When I've had to fly Southwest or USAir I've been disappointed in comparison.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4"}

I have been coming here for ages.\nMy favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich.

{"prompt":"The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.\n\nHere's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.  The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5"}
{"prompt":"This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.\n\nThe menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!\n\nAnyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4"}
{"prompt":"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\n\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.\n\nAnyway, I can't wait to go back!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5"}
{"prompt":"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.

{"prompt":"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.\nService was excellent, and highly attentive.\nFood, absolutely horrible.\n\nMy expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. \nWhat I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1\/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. \nWhat I got a a 3\/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. \nSalad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet\nVeggies, blah.\nBread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. \n\nIn addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. \n\nI've had it with this place.\nIf I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1\/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1"}
{"prompt":"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place.

I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. \nOnce, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date!

{"prompt":"There's two ways to look at this place. One is getting quality food at a good price. The other is getting a lot of food for a cheap price. I prefer the former but those who prefer the latter won't agree with my review.\n\nI thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance...
