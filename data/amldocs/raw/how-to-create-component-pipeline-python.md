# Create and run machine learning pipelines using components with the Azure Machine Learning SDK v2

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](../../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

In this article, you learn how to build an [Azure Machine Learning pipeline](concept-ml-pipelines.md) using Python SDK v2 to complete an image classification task containing three steps: prepare data, train an image classification model, and score the model. Machine learning pipelines optimize your workflow with speed, portability, and reuse, so you can focus on machine learning instead of infrastructure and automation.  

The example trains a small [Keras](https://keras.io/) convolutional neural network to classify images in the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset. The pipeline looks like following.

In this article, you complete the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prepare input data for the pipeline job
> * Create three components to prepare the data, train and score
> * Compose a Pipeline from the components
> * Get access to workspace with compute
> * Submit the pipeline job
> * Review the output of the components and the trained neural network
> * (Optional) Register the component for further reuse and sharing within workspace

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) today.

## Prerequisites

* Complete the [Quickstart: Get started with Azure Machine Learning](quickstart-create-resources.md) if you don't already have an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
* A Python environment in which you've installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/sdk-preview/sdk#getting-started) - check the getting started section. This environment is for defining and controlling your Azure Machine Learning resources and is separate from the environment used at runtime for training.
* Clone examples repository

    To run the training examples, first clone the examples repository and change into the `sdk` directory:

    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --branch sdk-preview
    cd azureml-examples/sdk
    ```

## Start an interactive Python session

This article uses the Python SDK for Azure ML to create and control an Azure Machine Learning pipeline. The article assumes that you'll be running the code snippets interactively in either a Python REPL environment or a Jupyter notebook.

This article is based on the [image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb) notebook found in the `sdk/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet` directory of the [AzureML Examples](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples) repository.

## Import required libraries

Import all the Azure Machine Learning required libraries that you'll need for this article:

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=required-library)]

## Prepare input data for your pipeline job

You need to prepare the input data for this image classification pipeline.

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of fashion images divided into 10 classes. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image and there are 60,000 training and 10,000 test images. As an image classification problem, Fashion-MNIST is harder than the classic MNIST handwritten digit database. It's distributed in the same compressed binary form as the original [handwritten digit database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

To define the input data of a job that references the Web-based data, run:

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=define-input)]

By defining an `Input`, you create a reference to the data source location. The data remains in its existing location, so no extra storage cost is incurred.

## Create components for building pipeline

The image classification task can be split into three steps: prepare data, train model and score model.

[Azure Machine Learning component](concept-component.md) is a self-contained piece of code that does one step in a machine learning pipeline. In this article, you'll create three components for the image classification task:

- Prepare data for training and test
- Train a neural networking for image classification using training data
- Score the model using test data

For each component, you need to prepare the following staff:

1. Prepare the Python script containing the execution logic

1. Define the interface of the component,

1. Add other metadata of the component, including run-time environment, command to run the component, and etc.

The next section will show create components in two different ways: the first two components using Python function and the third component using yaml definition.

### Create the data-preparation component

The first component in this pipeline will convert the compressed data files of `fashion_ds` into two csv files, one for training and the other for scoring. You'll use Python function to define this component.

If you're following along with the example in the [AzureML Examples repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet), the source files are already available in `prep/` folder. This folder contains two files to construct the component: `prep_component.py`, which defines the component and `conda.yaml`, which defines the run-time environment of the component.

#### Define component using Python function

By using command_component() function as a decorator, you can easily define the component's interface, metadata and code to execute from a Python function. Each decorated Python function will be transformed into a single static specification (YAML) that the pipeline service can process.

:::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/prep/prep_component.py":::

The code above define a component with display name `Prep Data` using `@command_component` decorator:

* `name` is the unique identifier of the component.
* `version` is the current version of the component. A component can have multiple versions.
* `display_name` is a friendly display name of the component in UI, which isn't unique.
* `description` usually describes what task this component can complete.
* `environment` specifies the run-time environment for this component. The environment of this component specifies a docker image and refers to the `conda.yaml` file.

    The `conda.yaml` file contains all packages used for the component like following:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-v2samplesreorg/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/prep/conda.yaml":::

* The `prepare_data_component` function defines one input for `input_data` and two outputs for `training_data` and `test_data`. 
`input_data` is input data path. `training_data` and `test_data` are output data paths for training data and test data. 
* This component converts the data from `input_data` into a training data csv to `training_data` and a test data csv to `test_data`.

Following is what a component looks like in the studio UI.

- A component is a block in a pipeline graph.
- The `input_data`, `training_data` and `test_data` are ports of the component, which connects to other components for data streaming.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-component-pipeline-python/prep-data-component.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Prep Data component in the UI and code." lightbox ="./media/how-to-create-component-pipeline-python/prep-data-component.png":::

Now, you've prepared all source files for the `Prep Data` component.


### Create the train-model component

In this section, you'll create a component for training the image classification model in the Python function like the `Prep Data` component.

The difference is that since the training logic is more complicated, you can put the original training code in a separate Python file.

The source files of this component are under `train/` folder in the [AzureML Examples repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet). This folder contains three files to construct the component:

- `train.py`: contains the actual logic to train model.
- `train_component.py`: defines the interface of the component and imports the function in `train.py`.
-  `conda.yaml`: defines the run-time environment of the component.

#### Get a script containing execution logic

The `train.py` file contains a normal Python function, which performs the training model logic to train a Keras neural network for image classification. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/train/train.py).

#### Define component using Python function

After defining the training function successfully, you can use @command_component in Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 to wrap your function as a component, which can be used in AzureML pipelines.

:::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/train/train_component.py":::

The code above define a component with display name `Train Image Classification Keras` using `@command_component`:

* The `keras_train_component` function defines one input `input_data` where training data comes from, one input `epochs` specifying epochs during training, and one output `output_model` where outputs the model file. The default value of `epochs` is 10. The execution logic of this component is from `train()` function in `train.py` above.

The train-model component has a slightly more complex configuration than the prep-data component. The `conda.yaml` is like following:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/train/conda.yaml":::

Now, you've prepared all source files for the `Train Image Classification Keras` component.

### Create the score-model component

In this section, other than the previous components, you'll create a component to score the trained model via Yaml specification and script.

If you're following along with the example in the [AzureML Examples repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet), the source files are already available in `score/` folder. This folder contains three files to construct the component:

- `score.py`: contains the source code of the component.
- `score.yaml`: defines the interface and other details of the component.
- `conda.yaml`: defines the run-time environment of the component.

#### Get a script containing execution logic

The `score.py` file contains a normal Python function, which performs the training model logic.

:::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/score/score.py":::


The code in score.py takes three command-line arguments: `input_data`, `input_model` and `output_result`. The program score the input model using input data and then output the scoring result.

#### Define component via Yaml

In this section, you'll learn to create a component specification in the valid YAML component specification format. This file specifies the following information:

- Metadata: name, display_name, version, type, and so on.
- Interface: inputs and outputs
- Command, code, & environment: The command, code, and environment used to run the component

:::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/score/score.yaml":::

* `name` is the unique identifier of the component. Its display name is `Score Image Classification Keras`. 
* This component has two inputs and one output. 
* The source code path of it's defined in the `code` section and when the component is run in cloud, all files from that path will be uploaded as the snapshot of this component. 
* The `command` section specifies the command to execute while running this component. 
* The `environment` section contains a docker image and a conda yaml file. The source file is in the [sample repository](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/v2samplesreorg/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/score/conda.yaml).

Now, you've got all source files for score-model component.

## Load components to build pipeline

For prep-data component and train-model component defined by Python function, you can import the components just like normal Python functions. 

In the following code, you import `prepare_data_component()` and `keras_train_component()` function from the `prep_component.py` file under `prep` folder and `train_component` file under `train` folder respectively.

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=load-from-dsl-component)]

For score component defined by yaml, you can use `load_component()` function to load.

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=load-from-yaml)]

## Build your pipeline

Now that you've created and loaded all components and input data to build the pipeline. You can compose them into a pipeline:

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=build-pipeline)]

The pipeline has a default compute `cpu_compute_target`, which means if you don't specify compute for a specific node, that node will run on the default compute.

The pipeline has a pipeline level input `pipeline_input_data`. You can assign value to pipeline input when you submit a pipeline job.

The pipeline contains three nodes, prepare_data_node, train_node and score_node. 

- The `input_data` of `prepare_data_node` uses the value of `pipeline_input_data`.

- The `input_data` of `train_node` is from the `training_data` output of the prepare_data_node. 

- The `input_data` of score_node is from the `test_data` output of prepare_data_node, and the `input_model` is from the `output_model` of train_node. 
    
- Since `train_node` will train a CNN model, you can specify its compute as the gpu_compute_target, which can improve the training performance.

## Submit your pipeline job

Now you've constructed the pipeline, you can submit to your workspace. To submit a job, you need to firstly connect to a workspace.

### Get access to your workspace

#### Configure credential

We'll use `DefaultAzureCredential` to get access to the workspace. `DefaultAzureCredential` should be capable of handling most Azure SDK authentication scenarios.

Reference for more available credentials if it doesn't work for you: [configure credential example](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/configuration.ipynb), [azure-identity reference doc](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity?view=azure-python&preserve-view=true ).


[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=credential)]

#### Get a handle to a workspace with compute

Create a `MLClient` object to manage Azure Machine Learning services.

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=workspace)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This code snippet expects the workspace configuration json file to be saved in the current directory or its parent. For more information on creating a workspace, see [Create workspace resources](quickstart-create-resources.md). For more information on saving the configuration to file, see [Create a workspace configuration file](how-to-configure-environment.md#local-and-dsvm-only-create-a-workspace-configuration-file).

#### Submit pipeline job to workspace

Now you've get a handle to your workspace, you can submit your pipeline job.

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=submit-pipeline)]


The code above submit this image classification pipeline job to experiment called `pipeline_samples`. It will auto create the experiment if not exists. The `pipeline_input_data` uses `fashion_ds`.

The call to `pipeline_job`produces output similar to:

The call to `submit` the `Experiment` completes quickly, and produces output similar to:

| Experiment | Name | Type | Status | Details Page |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| pipeline_samples | sharp_pipe_4gvqx6h1fb | pipeline | Preparing | Link to Azure Machine Learning studio. |

You can monitor the pipeline run by opening the link or you can block until it completes by running:

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=stream-pipeline)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first pipeline run takes roughly *15 minutes*. All dependencies must be downloaded, a Docker image is created, and the Python environment is provisioned and created. Running the pipeline again takes significantly less time because those resources are reused instead of created. However, total run time for the pipeline depends on the workload of your scripts and the processes that are running in each pipeline step.

### Checkout outputs and debug your pipeline in UI

You can open the `Link to Azure Machine Learning studio`, which is the job detail page of your pipeline. You'll see the pipeline graph like following.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-component-pipeline-python/pipeline-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pipeline job detail page." lightbox ="./media/how-to-create-component-pipeline-python/pipeline-ui.png":::

You can check the logs and outputs of each component by right clicking the component, or select the component to open its detail pane. To learn more about how to debug your pipeline in UI, see [How to use studio UI to build and debug Azure ML pipelines](how-to-use-pipeline-ui.md).

## (Optional) Register components to workspace

In the previous section, you have built a pipeline using three components to E2E complete an image classification task. You can also register components to your workspace so that they can be shared and resued within the workspace. Following is an example to register prep-data component.

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/python/jobs/pipelines/2e_image_classification_keras_minist_convnet/image_classification_keras_minist_convnet.ipynb?name=register-component)]

Using `ml_client.components.get()`, you can get a registered component by name and version. Using `ml_client.compoennts.create_or_update()`, you can register a component previously loaded from Python function or yaml.
