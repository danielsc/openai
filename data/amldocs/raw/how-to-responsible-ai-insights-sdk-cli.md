# Generate a Responsible AI insights with YAML and Python

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](../../includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

You can generate a Responsible AI dashboard and scorecard via a pipeline job by using Responsible AI components. There are six core components for creating Responsible AI dashboards, along with a couple of helper components. Here's a sample experiment graph:

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-insights-sdk-cli/sample-experiment-graph.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample experiment graph." lightbox= "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-insights-sdk-cli/sample-experiment-graph.png":::

## Responsible AI components

The core components for constructing the Responsible AI dashboard in Azure Machine Learning are:

- `RAI Insights dashboard constructor`
- The tool components:
    - `Add Explanation to RAI Insights dashboard`
    - `Add Causal to RAI Insights dashboard`
    - `Add Counterfactuals to RAI Insights dashboard`
    - `Add Error Analysis to RAI Insights dashboard`
    - `Gather RAI Insights dashboard`
    - `Gather RAI Insights score card`

The `RAI Insights dashboard constructor` and `Gather RAI Insights dashboard` components are always required, plus at least one of the tool components. However, it isn't necessary to use all the tools in every Responsible AI dashboard.  

In the following sections are specifications of the Responsible AI components and examples of code snippets in YAML and Python. To view the full code, see [sample YAML and Python notebook](https://aka.ms/RAIsamplesProgrammer).

### Limitations

The current set of components have a number of limitations on their use:

- All models must be registered in Azure Machine Learning in MLflow format with a sklearn (scikit-learn) flavor.
- The models must be loadable in the component environment.
- The models must be pickleable.
- The models must be supplied to the Responsible AI components by using the `Fetch Registered Model` component, which we provide.
- The dataset inputs must be in `mltable` format.
- A model must be supplied even if only a causal analysis of the data is performed. You can use the `DummyClassifier` and `DummyRegressor` estimators from scikit-learn for this purpose.

### RAI Insights dashboard constructor

This component has three input ports:

- The machine learning model  
- The training dataset  
- The test dataset  

To generate model-debugging insights with components such as error analysis and Model explanations, use the training and test dataset that you used when you trained your model. For components like causal analysis, which doesn't require a model, you use the training dataset to train the causal model to generate the causal insights. You use the test dataset to populate your Responsible AI dashboard visualizations.

The easiest way to supply the model is to register the input model and reference the same model in the model input port of `RAI Insight Constructor` component, which we discuss later in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only models in MLflow format and with a `sklearn` flavor are supported.

The two datasets should be in `mltable` format. The training and test datasets provided don't have to be the same datasets that are used in training the model, but they can be the same. By default, for performance reasons, the test dataset is restricted to 5,000 rows of the visualization UI.

The constructor component also accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter name | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Brief description of the dashboard. | String |
| `task_type` | Specifies whether the model is for classification or regression. | String, `classification` or `regression` |
| `target_column_name` | The name of the column in the input datasets, which the model is trying to predict. | String |
| `maximum_rows_for_test_dataset` | The maximum number of rows allowed in the test dataset, for performance reasons. | Integer, defaults to 5,000 |
| `categorical_column_names` | The columns in the datasets, which represent categorical data. | Optional list of strings<sup>1</sup> |
| `classes` | The full list of class labels in the training dataset. | Optional list of strings<sup>1</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> The lists should be supplied as a single JSON-encoded string for `categorical_column_names` and `classes` inputs.

The constructor component has a single output named `rai_insights_dashboard`. This is an empty dashboard, which the individual tool components operate on. All the results are assembled by the `Gather RAI Insights dashboard` component at the end.

| `categories` | The categories to use for the categorical columns. If `auto`, the categories will be inferred for all categorical columns. Otherwise, this argument should have as many entries as there are categorical columns.<br><br>Each entry should be either `auto` to infer the values for that column or the list of values for the column.  If explicit values are provided, the first value is treated as the "control" value for that column against which other values are compared. | Optional, `auto` or list<sup>2</sup>. |
| `n_jobs` | The degree of parallelism to use. | Optional integer, defaults to 1. |
| `verbose` | Expresses whether to provide detailed output during the computation. | Optional integer, defaults to 1. |
| `random_state` | Seed for the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). | Optional integer. |

<sup>2</sup> For the `list` parameters: Several of the parameters accept lists of other types (strings, numbers, even other lists). To pass these into the component, they must first be JSON-encoded into a single string.

## How to generate a Responsible AI scorecard (preview)

The configuration stage requires you to use your domain expertise around the problem to set your desired target values on model performance and fairness metrics. 

Like other Responsible AI dashboard components configured in the YAML pipeline, you can add a component to generate the scorecard in the YAML pipeline:

```yml
scorecard_01: 

   type: command 
   component: azureml:rai_score_card@latest 
   inputs: 
     dashboard: ${{parent.jobs.gather_01.outputs.dashboard}} 
     pdf_generation_config: 
       type: uri_file 
       path: ./pdf_gen.json 
       mode: download 

     predefined_cohorts_json: 
       type: uri_file 
       path: ./cohorts.json 
       mode: download 

```

Where pdf_gen.json is the score card generation configuration json file, and *predifined_cohorts_json* ID the prebuilt cohorts definition json file. 

Here's a sample JSON file for cohorts definition and scorecard-generation configuration:


Cohorts definition:
```yml
[ 
  { 
    "name": "High Yoe", 
    "cohort_filter_list": [ 
      { 
        "method": "greater", 
        "arg": [ 
          5 
        ], 
        "column": "YOE" 
      } 
    ] 
  }, 
  { 
    "name": "Low Yoe", 
    "cohort_filter_list": [ 
      { 
        "method": "less", 
        "arg": [ 
          6.5 
        ], 
        "column": "YOE" 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
] 
```

Here's a scorecard-generation configuration file as a regression example:

```yml
{ 
  "Model": { 
    "ModelName": "GPT-2 Access", 
    "ModelType": "Regression", 
    "ModelSummary": "This is a regression model to analyze how likely a programmer is given access to GPT-2" 
  }, 
  "Metrics": { 
    "mean_absolute_error": { 
      "threshold": "<=20" 
    }, 
    "mean_squared_error": {} 
  }, 
  "FeatureImportance": { 
    "top_n": 6 
  }, 
  "DataExplorer": { 
    "features": [ 
      "YOE", 
      "age" 
    ] 
  }, 
  "Fairness": {
    "metric": ["mean_squared_error"],
    "sensitive_features": ["YOUR SENSITIVE ATTRIBUTE"],
    "fairness_evaluation_kind": "difference OR ratio"
  },
  "Cohorts": [ 
    "High Yoe", 
    "Low Yoe" 
  ]  
} 
```

Here's a scorecard-generation configuration file as a classification example:

```yml
{
  "Model": {
    "ModelName": "Housing Price Range Prediction",
    "ModelType": "Classification",
    "ModelSummary": "This model is a classifier that predicts whether the house will sell for more than the median price."
  },
  "Metrics" :{
    "accuracy_score": {
        "threshold": ">=0.85"
    },
  }
  "FeatureImportance": { 
    "top_n": 6 
  }, 
  "DataExplorer": { 
    "features": [ 
      "YearBuilt", 
      "OverallQual", 
      "GarageCars"
    ] 
  },
  "Fairness": {
    "metric": ["accuracy_score", "selection_rate"],
    "sensitive_features": ["YOUR SENSITIVE ATTRIBUTE"],
    "fairness_evaluation_kind": "difference OR ratio"
  }
}
```

## Input constraints

### What model formats and flavors are supported?

The model must be in the MLflow directory with a sklearn flavor available. Additionally, the model needs to be loadable in the environment that's used by the Responsible AI components.

### What data formats are supported?
