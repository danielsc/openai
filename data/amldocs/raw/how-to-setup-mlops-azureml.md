# Set up MLOps with Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](../../includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

Azure Machine Learning allows you to integrate with [Azure DevOps pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/) to automate the machine learning lifecycle. Some of the operations you can automate are:

* Deployment of AzureML infrastructure
* Data preparation (extract, transform, load operations)
* Training machine learning models with on-demand scale-out and scale-up
* Deployment of machine learning models as public or private web services
* Monitoring deployed machine learning models (such as for performance analysis)

In this article, you learn about using Azure Machine Learning to set up an end-to-end MLOps pipeline that runs a linear regression to predict taxi fares in NYC. The pipeline is made up of components, each serving  different functions, which can be registered with the workspace, versioned, and reused with various inputs and outputs. you're going to be using the [recommended Azure architecture for MLOps](/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/machine-learning-operations-v2) and [Azure MLOps (v2) solution accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2) to quickly setup an MLOps project in AzureML.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend you understand some of the [recommended Azure architectures](/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/machine-learning-operations-v2) for MLOps before implementing any solution. You'll need to pick the best architecture for your given Machine learning project.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- An Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- Git running on your local machine.
- An [organization](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization) in Azure DevOps.
- [Azure DevOps project](how-to-devops-machine-learning.md) that will host the source repositories and pipelines.
- The [Terraform extension for Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks) if you're using Azure DevOps + Terraform to spin up infrastructure

> [!NOTE]
>
>Git version 2.27 or newer is required. For more information on installing the Git command, see https://git-scm.com/downloads and select your operating system

> [!IMPORTANT]
>The CLI commands in this article were tested using Bash. If you use a different shell, you may encounter errors.

## Set up authentication with Azure and DevOps

Before you can set up an MLOps project with AzureML, you need to set up authentication for Azure DevOps.

### Create service principal
   For the use of the demo, the creation of one or two service principles is required, depending on how many environments, you want to work on (Dev or Prod or Both). These principles can be created using one of the following methods:

# [Create from Azure Cloud Shell](#tab/azure-shell)

1. Launch the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).

    > [!TIP]
    > The first time you've launched the Cloud Shell, you'll be prompted to create a storage account for the Cloud Shell.

1. If prompted, choose **Bash** as the environment used in the Cloud Shell. You can also change environments in the drop-down on the top navigation bar

    ![Screenshot of the cloud shell environment dropdown.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/PS_CLI1_1.png)

1. Copy the following bash commands to your computer and update the **projectName**, **subscriptionId**, and **environment** variables with the values for your project. If you're creating both a Dev and Prod environment, you'll need to run this script once for each environment, creating a service principal for each. This command will also grant the **Contributor** role to the service principal in the subscription provided. This is required for Azure DevOps to properly use resources in that subscription. 

    ``` bash
    projectName="<your project name>"
    roleName="Contributor"
    subscriptionId="<subscription Id>"
    environment="<Dev|Prod>" #First letter should be capitalized
    servicePrincipalName="Azure-ARM-${environment}-${projectName}"
    # Verify the ID of the active subscription
    echo "Using subscription ID $subscriptionID"
    echo "Creating SP for RBAC with name $servicePrincipalName, with role $roleName and in scopes     /subscriptions/$subscriptionId"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $servicePrincipalName --role $roleName --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
    echo "Please ensure that the information created here is properly save for future use."
    ```

1. Copy your edited commands into the Azure Shell and run them (**Ctrl** + **Shift** + **v**).

1. After running these commands, you'll be presented with information related to the service principal. Save this information to a safe location, it will be use later in the demo to configure Azure DevOps.

    ```json
    {
       "appId": "<application id>",
       "displayName": "Azure-ARM-dev-Sample_Project_Name",
       "password": "<password>",
       "tenant": "<tenant id>"
    }
    ```

1. Repeat **Step 3.** if you're creating service principals for Dev and Prod environments. For this demo, we'll be creating only one environment, which is Prod.

1. Close the Cloud Shell once the service principals are created. 
      

# [Create from Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Navigate to [Azure App Registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade/quickStartType~/null/sourceTypeMicrosoft_AAD_IAM)

1. Select **New Registration**.

    ![Screenshot of service principal setup.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/SP-setup-ownership-tab.png)

1. Go through the process of creating a Service Principle (SP) selecting **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** and name it  **Azure-ARM-Dev-ProjectName**. Once created, repeat and create a new SP named **Azure-ARM-Prod-ProjectName**. Replace **ProjectName** with the name of your project so that the service principal can be uniquely identified. 

1. Go to **Certificates & Secrets** and add for each SP **New client secret**, then store the value and secret separately.

1. To assign the necessary permissions to these principals, select your respective [subscription](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_BillingSubscriptionsBlade?) and go to IAM. Select **+Add** then select **Add Role Assignment**.

    ![Screenshot of the add role assignment page.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/SP-setup-iam-tab.png)

1. Select Contributor and add members selecting + Select Members. Add the member **Azure-ARM-Dev-ProjectName** as create before.

    ![Screenshot of the add role assignment selection.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/SP-setup-role-assignment.png)

1. Repeat step here, if you deploy Dev and Prod into the same subscription, otherwise change to the prod subscription and repeat with **Azure-ARM-Prod-ProjectName**. The basic SP setup is successfully finished.

## Deploying infrastructure via Azure DevOps
This step deploys the training pipeline to the Azure Machine Learning workspace created in the previous steps. 

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you understand the [Architectural Patterns](/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/machine-learning-operations-v2) of the solution accelerator before you checkout the MLOps v2 repo and deploy the infrastructure. In examples you'll use the [classical ML project type](/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/machine-learning-operations-v2#classical-machine-learning-architecture).

### Run Azure infrastructure pipeline
1. Go to your repository, `mlops-v2-ado-demo`, and select the **config-infra-prod.yml** file.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure you've selected the **main** branch of the repo.
   
   ![Screenshot of Repo in ADO.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-repo.png)
   
   This config file uses the namespace and postfix values the names of the artifacts to ensure uniqueness. Update the following section in the config to your liking.
   
   ```
    namespace: [5 max random new letters]
    postfix: [4 max random new digits]
    location: eastus
   ```
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are running a Deep Learning workload such as CV or NLP, ensure your GPU compute is available in your deployment zone.

1. Select Commit and push code to get these values into the pipeline. 

1. Go to Pipelines section 
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO Pipelines.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-pipelines.png)
   
1. Select **New Pipeline**.
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO New Pipeline button for infra.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-new-pipeline.png)
   
1. Select **Azure Repos Git**.
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO Where's your code.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ado-wheresyourcode.png)
   
1. Select the repository that you cloned in from the previous section `mlops-v2-ado-demo`
   
1. Select **Existing Azure Pipeline YAML File**
   
   ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps Pipeline page on configure step.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-configure-pipelines.png)
   
   
1. Select the `main` branch and choose `mlops/devops-pipelines/cli-ado-deploy-infra.yml`, then select **Continue**. 

1. Run the pipeline; it will take a few minutes to finish. The pipeline should create the following artifacts:
   * Resource Group for your Workspace including Storage Account, Container Registry, Application Insights, Keyvault and the Azure Machine Learning Workspace itself.
   * In the workspace, there's also a compute cluster created.
   
1. Now the Operationalizing Loop of the MLOps Architecture is deployed.
    ![Screenshot of ADO Infra Pipeline screen.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-infra-pipeline.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Unable move and reuse existing repository to required location** warnings may be ignored.

## Deploying model training pipeline and moving to test environment

1. Go to ADO pipelines
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO Pipelines.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-pipelines.png)

1. Select **New Pipeline**.
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO New Pipeline button.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-new-pipeline.png)

1. Select **Existing Azure Pipeline YAML File**
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO Pipeline page on configure step.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-configure-pipelines.png)
   
1. Select `main` as a branch and choose `/mlops/devops-pipelines/deploy-model-training-pipeline.yml`, then select **Continue**.  

1. **Save and Run** the pipeline
   
> [!NOTE]
> At this point, the infrastructure is configured and the Prototyping Loop of the MLOps Architecture is deployed. you're ready to move to our trained model to production.      

## Moving to production environment and deploying model 
         
**Prepare Data**
   - This component takes multiple taxi datasets (yellow and green) and merges/filters the data, and prepare the train/val and evaluation datasets.
   - Input: Local data under ./data/ (multiple .csv files)
   - Output: Single prepared dataset (.csv) and train/val/test datasets.

**Train Model**
   - This component trains a Linear Regressor with the training set.
   - Input: Training dataset
   - Output: Trained model (pickle format)
   
**Evaluate Model**
   - This component uses the trained model to predict taxi fares on the test set.
   - Input: ML model and Test dataset
   - Output: Performance of model and a deploy flag whether to deploy or not.
   - This component compares the performance of the model with all previous deployed models on the new test dataset and decides whether to promote or not model into production. Promoting model into production happens by registering the model in AML workspace.

**Register Model**
   - This component scores the model based on how accurate the predictions are in the test set.
   - Input: Trained model and the deploy flag.
   - Output: Registered model in Azure Machine Learning.

### Deploy ML model endpoint
1. Go to ADO pipelines
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO Pipelines.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-pipelines.png)

1. Select **New Pipeline**.
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO New Pipeline button for endpoint.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-new-pipeline.png)
   
1. Select **Azure Repos Git**.
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO Where's your code.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ado-wheresyourcode.png)
   
1. Select the repository that you cloned in from the previous section `mlopsv2`
   
1. Select **Existing Azure Pipeline YAML File**
   
   ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps Pipeline page on configure step.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-configure-pipelines.png)
   
1. Select `main` as a branch and choose Managed Online Endpoint `/mlops/devops-pipelines/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml` then select **Continue**.  
   
1. Online endpoint names need to be unique, so change `taxi-online-$(namespace)$(postfix)$(environment)` to another unique name and then select **Run**. No need to change the default if it doesn't fail.

   ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps batch deploy script.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-batch-pipeline.png)
   
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the run fails due to an existing online endpoint name, recreate the pipeline as described previously and change **[your endpoint-name]** to **[your endpoint-name (random number)]**
   
1. When the run completes, you'll see output similar to the following image:
   
   ![Screenshot of ADO Pipeline batch run result page.](./media/how-to-setup-mlops-azureml/ADO-batch-pipeline-run.png)
   
   Now the Prototyping Loop is connected to the Operationalizing Loop of the MLOps Architecture and inference has been run.

## Clean up resources

1. If you're not going to continue to use your pipeline, delete your Azure DevOps project. 
1. In Azure portal, delete your resource group and Azure Machine Learning instance.
