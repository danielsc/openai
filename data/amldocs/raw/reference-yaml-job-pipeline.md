## YAML syntax

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `$schema` | string | The YAML schema. If you use the Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension to author the YAML file, including `$schema` at the top of your file enables you to invoke schema and resource completions. | | |
| `type` | const | **Required.** The type of job. | `pipeline` | |
| `name` | string | Name of the job. Must be unique across all jobs in the workspace. If omitted, Azure ML will autogenerate a GUID for the name. | | |
| `display_name` | string | Display name of the job in the studio UI. Can be non-unique within the workspace. If omitted, Azure ML will autogenerate a human-readable adjective-noun identifier for the display name. | | |
| `experiment_name` | string | Experiment name to organize the job under. Each job's run record will be organized under the corresponding experiment in the studio's "Experiments" tab. If omitted, Azure ML will default it to the name of the working directory where the job was created. | | |
| `description` | string | Description of the job. | | |
| `tags` | object | Dictionary of tags for the job. | | |
| `settings` | object | Default settings for the pipeline job. See [Attributes of the `settings` key](#attributes-of-the-settings-key) for the set of configurable properties. | | |
| `jobs` | object | **Required.** Dictionary of the set of individual jobs to run as steps within the pipeline. These jobs are considered child jobs of the parent pipeline job. <br><br> The key is the name of the step within the context of the pipeline job. This name is different from the unique job name of the child job. The value is the job specification, which can follow the [command job schema](reference-yaml-job-command.md#yaml-syntax) or [sweep job schema](reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#yaml-syntax). Currently only command jobs and sweep jobs can be run in a pipeline. Later releases will have support for other job types. | | |
| `inputs` | object | Dictionary of inputs to the pipeline job. The key is a name for the input within the context of the job and the value is the input value. <br><br> These pipeline inputs can be referenced by the inputs of an individual step job in the pipeline using the `${{ parent.inputs.<input_name> }}` expression. For more information on how to bind the inputs of a pipeline step to the inputs of the top-level pipeline job, see the [Expression syntax for binding inputs and outputs between steps in a pipeline job](reference-yaml-core-syntax.md#binding-inputs-and-outputs-between-steps-in-a-pipeline-job). | | |
| `inputs.<input_name>` | number, integer, boolean, string or object | One of a literal value (of type number, integer, boolean, or string) or an object containing a [job input data specification](#job-inputs). | | |
| `outputs` | object | Dictionary of output configurations of the pipeline job. The key is a name for the output within the context of the job and the value is the output configuration. <br><br> These pipeline outputs can be referenced by the outputs of an individual step job in the pipeline using the `${{ parents.outputs.<output_name> }}` expression. For more information on how to bind the inputs of a pipeline step to the inputs of the top-level pipeline job, see the [Expression syntax for binding inputs and outputs between steps in a pipeline job](reference-yaml-core-syntax.md#binding-inputs-and-outputs-between-steps-in-a-pipeline-job). | |
| `outputs.<output_name>` | object | You can leave the object empty, in which case by default the output will be of type `uri_folder` and Azure ML will system-generate an output location for the output based on the following templatized path: `{settings.datastore}/azureml/{job-name}/{output-name}/`. File(s) to the output directory will be written via read-write mount. If you want to specify a different mode for the output, provide an object containing the [job output specification](#job-outputs). | |
| `identity` | object | The identity is used for data accessing. It can be [UserIdentityConfiguration](#useridentityconfiguration), [ManagedIdentityConfiguration](#managedidentityconfiguration) or None. If it's UserIdentityConfiguration the identity of job submitter will be used to access input data and write result to output folder, otherwise, the managed identity of the compute target will be used. | |

### Attributes of the `settings` key

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `default_datastore` | string | Name of the datastore to use as the default datastore for the pipeline job. This value must be a reference to an existing datastore in the workspace using the `azureml:<datastore-name>` syntax. Any outputs defined in the `outputs` property of the parent pipeline job or child step jobs will be stored in this datastore. If omitted, outputs will be stored in the workspace blob datastore. | |
| `default_compute` | string | Name of the compute target to use as the default compute for all steps in the pipeline. If compute is defined at the step level, it will override this default compute for that specific step. This value must be a reference to an existing compute in the workspace using the `azureml:<compute-name>` syntax. | |
| `continue_on_step_failure` | boolean | Whether the execution of steps in the pipeline should continue if one step fails. The default value is `False`, which means that if one step fails, the pipeline execution will be stopped, canceling any running steps. | `False` |
| `force_rerun` | boolean | Whether to force rerun the whole pipeline. The default value is `False`, which means by default the pipeline will try to reuse the previous job's output if it meets reuse criteria. If set as `True`, all steps in the pipeline will rerun.| `False` |

### Job inputs

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `type` | string | The type of job input. Specify `uri_file` for input data that points to a single file source, or `uri_folder` for input data that points to a folder source. [Learn more about data access.](concept-data.md)| `uri_file`, `uri_folder`, `mltable`, `mlflow_model` | `uri_folder` |
| `path` | string | The path to the data to use as input. This can be specified in a few ways: <br><br> - A local path to the data source file or folder, e.g. `path: ./iris.csv`. The data will get uploaded during job submission. <br><br> - A URI of a cloud path to the file or folder to use as the input. Supported URI types are `azureml`, `https`, `wasbs`, `abfss`, `adl`. See [Core yaml syntax](reference-yaml-core-syntax.md) for more information on how to use the `azureml://` URI format. <br><br> - An existing registered Azure ML data asset to use as the input. To reference a registered data asset use the `azureml:<data_name>:<data_version>` syntax or `azureml:<data_name>@latest` (to reference the latest version of that data asset), e.g. `path: azureml:cifar10-data:1` or `path: azureml:cifar10-data@latest`. | | |
| `mode` | string | Mode of how the data should be delivered to the compute target. <br><br> For read-only mount (`ro_mount`), the data will be consumed as a mount path. A folder will be mounted as a folder and a file will be mounted as a file. Azure ML will resolve the input to the mount path. <br><br> For `download` mode the data will be downloaded to the compute target. Azure ML will resolve the input to the downloaded path. <br><br> If you only want the URL of the storage location of the data artifact(s) rather than mounting or downloading the data itself, you can use the `direct` mode. This will pass in the URL of the storage location as the job input. Note that in this case you are fully responsible for handling credentials to access the storage. | `ro_mount`, `download`, `direct` | `ro_mount` |

### Job outputs

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `type` | string | The type of job output. For the default `uri_folder` type, the output will correspond to a folder. | `uri_file`, `uri_folder`, `mltable`, `mlflow_model` | `uri_folder` |
| `mode` | string | Mode of how output file(s) will get delivered to the destination storage. For read-write mount mode (`rw_mount`) the output directory will be a mounted directory. For upload mode the file(s) written will get uploaded at the end of the job. | `rw_mount`, `upload` | `rw_mount` |

### Identity configurations

#### UserIdentityConfiguration

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `type` | const | **Required.** Identity type.  | `user_identity` |

#### ManagedIdentityConfiguration

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `type` | const | **Required.** Identity type.  | `managed` or `managed_identity` |

## Remarks

The `az ml job` commands can be used for managing Azure Machine Learning pipeline jobs.
