# Example pipelines & datasets for Azure Machine Learning designer

Use the built-in examples in Azure Machine Learning designer to quickly get started building your own machine learning pipelines. The Azure Machine Learning designer [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningDesigner) contains detailed documentation to help you understand some common  machine learning scenarios.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* An Azure Machine Learning workspace 

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-missing-ui](../../includes/machine-learning-missing-ui.md)]

## Use sample pipelines

The designer saves a copy of the sample pipelines to your studio workspace. You can edit the pipeline to adapt it to your needs and save it as your own. Use them as a starting point to jumpstart your projects.

Here's how to use a designer sample:

1. Sign in to <a href="https://ml.azure.com?tabs=jre" target="_blank">ml.azure.com</a>, and select the workspace you want to work with.

1. Select **Designer**.

1. Select a sample pipeline under the **New pipeline** section.

    Select **Show more samples** for a complete list of samples.

1. To run a pipeline, you first have to set default compute target to run the pipeline on.

   1. In the **Settings** pane to the right of the canvas, select **Select compute target**.

   1. In the dialog that appears, select an existing compute target or create a new one. Select **Save**.

   1. Select **Submit** at the top of the canvas to submit a pipeline job.

   Depending on the sample pipeline and compute settings, jobs may take some time to complete. The default compute settings have a minimum node size of 0, which means that the designer must allocate resources after being idle. Repeated pipeline jobs will take less time since the compute resources are already allocated. Additionally, the designer uses cached results for each component to further improve efficiency.


1. After the pipeline finishes running, you can review the pipeline and view the output for each component to learn more. Use the following steps to view component outputs:

   1. Right-click the component in the canvas whose output you'd like to see.
   1. Select **Visualize**.


   Use the samples as starting points for some of the most common machine learning scenarios.

## Datasets

When you create a new pipeline in Azure Machine Learning designer, a number of sample datasets are included by default. These sample datasets are used by the sample pipelines in the designer homepage. 

The sample datasets are available under **Datasets**-**Samples** category. You can find this in the component palette to the left of the canvas in the designer. You can use any of these datasets in your own pipeline by dragging it to the canvas.

| Adult Census Income Binary Classification dataset | A subset of the 1994 Census database, using working adults over the age of 16 with an adjusted income index of > 100.<br/>**Usage**: Classify people using demographics to predict whether a person earns over 50K a year.<br/> **Related Research**: Kohavi, R., Becker, B., (1996). [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science|
|Automobile price data (Raw)|Information about automobiles by make and model, including the price, features such as the number of cylinders and MPG, as well as an insurance risk score.<br/> The risk score is initially associated with auto price. It is then adjusted for actual risk in a process known to actuaries as symboling. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, and a value of -3 that it is probably safe.<br/>**Usage**: Predict the risk score by features, using regression or multivariate classification.<br/>**Related Research**: Schlimmer, J.C.

Before uploading to the designer, the dataset was processed as follows: <br/>-    The dataset was filtered to cover only the 70 busiest airports in the continental US <br/>- Canceled flights were labeled as delayed by more than 15 minutes <br/>- Diverted flights were filtered out <br/>- The following columns were selected: Year, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Carrier, OriginAirportID, DestAirportID, CRSDepTime, DepDelay, DepDel15, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, Canceled|

Each example represents a person. There are 20 features, both numerical and categorical, and a binary label (the credit risk value). High credit risk entries have label = 2, low credit risk entries have label = 1. The cost of misclassifying a low risk example as high is 1, whereas the cost of misclassifying a high risk example as low is 5.|

The dataset was introduced in the paper "S. Dooms, T. De Pessemier and L. Martens. MovieTweetings: a Movie Rating Dataset Collected From Twitter. Workshop on Crowdsourcing and Human Computation for Recommender Systems, CrowdRec at RecSys 2013."|
|Movie Ratings|The dataset is an extended version of the Movie Tweetings dataset. The dataset has 170K ratings for movies, extracted from well-structured tweets on Twitter. Each instance represents a tweet and is a tuple: user ID, IMDB movie ID, rating, timestamp, number of favorites for this tweet, and number of retweets of this tweet. The dataset was made available by A. Said, S. Dooms, B. Loni and D. Tikk for Recommender Systems Challenge 2014.|
|Weather Dataset|Hourly land-based weather observations from NOAA ([merged data from 201304 to 201310](https://az754797.vo.msecnd.net/data/WeatherDataset.csv)).<br/>The weather data covers observations made from airport weather stations, covering the time period April-October 2013. Before uploading to the designer, the dataset was processed as follows:    <br/> -    Weather station IDs were mapped to corresponding airport IDs    <br/> -    Weather stations not associated with the 70 busiest airports were filtered out    <br/> -    The Date column was split into separate Year, Month, and Day columns    <br/> - The following columns were selected: AirportID, Year, Month, Day, Time, TimeZone, SkyCondition, Visibility, WeatherType, DryBulbFarenheit, DryBulbCelsius, WetBulbFarenheit, WetBulbCelsius, DewPointFarenheit, DewPointCelsius, RelativeHumidity, WindSpeed, WindDirection, ValueForWindCharacter, StationPressure, PressureTendency, PressureChange, SeaLevelPressure, RecordType, HourlyPrecip, Altimeter|
