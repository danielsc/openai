# Customize the compute instance with a script 

Use a setup script for an automated way to customize and configure a compute instance at provisioning time. 

Use a compute instance as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud. For development and testing, you can also use the instance as a [training compute target](concept-compute-target.md#training-compute-targets) or for an [inference target](concept-compute-target.md#compute-targets-for-inference).   A compute instance can run multiple jobs in parallel and has a job queue. As a development environment, a compute instance can't be shared with other users in your workspace.

As an administrator, you can write a customization script to be used to provision all compute instances in the workspace according to your requirements. You can configure your setup script as a Creation script, which will run once when the compute instance is created. Or you can configure it as a Startup script, which will run every time the compute instance is started (including initial creation).

Some examples of what you can do in a setup script:

* Install packages, tools, and software
* Mount data
* Create custom conda environment and Jupyter kernels
* Clone git repositories and set git config
* Set network proxies
* Set environment variables
* Install JupyterLab extensions

## Create the setup script

The setup script is a shell script, which runs as `rootuser`.  Create or upload the script into your **Notebooks** files:

1. Sign into the [studio](https://ml.azure.com) and select your workspace.
2. On the left, select **Notebooks**
3. Use the **Add files** tool to create or upload your setup shell script.  Make sure the script filename ends in ".sh".  When you create a new file, also change the **File type** to *bash(.sh)*.

When the script runs, the current working directory of the script is the directory where it was uploaded. For example, if you upload the script to **Users>admin**, the location of the script on the compute instance and current working directory when the script runs is */home/azureuser/cloudfiles/code/Users/admin*. This location enables you to use relative paths in the script.

Script arguments can be referred to in the script as $1, $2, etc.

If your script was doing something specific to azureuser such as installing conda environment or Jupyter kernel, you'll have to put it within `sudo -u azureuser` block like this

:::code language="bash" source="~/azureml-examples-main/setup/setup-ci/install-pip-package.sh":::

The command `sudo -u azureuser` changes the current working directory to `/home/azureuser`. You also can't access the script arguments in this block.

For other example scripts, see [azureml-examples](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/setup/setup-ci).

You can also use the following environment variables in your script:

* `CI_RESOURCE_GROUP`
* `CI_WORKSPACE`
* `CI_NAME`
* `CI_LOCAL_UBUNTU_USER` - points to `azureuser`

Use a setup script in conjunction with **Azure Policy to either enforce or default a setup script for every compute instance creation**.
The default value for a setup script timeout is 15 minutes. The time can be changed in studio, or through ARM templates using the `DURATION` parameter.
`DURATION` is a floating point number with an optional suffix: `'s'` for seconds (the default), `'m'` for minutes, `'h'` for hours or `'d'` for days.

## Use the script in studio

Once you store the script, specify it during creation of your compute instance:

1. Sign into [studio](https://ml.azure.com/) and select your workspace.
1. On the left, select **Compute**.
1. Select **+New** to create a new compute instance.
1. [Fill out the form](how-to-create-manage-compute-instance.md?tabs=azure-studio#create).
1. On the second page of the form, open **Show advanced settings**.
1. Turn on **Provision with setup script**.
1. Select either **Creation script** or **Startup script** tab.
1. Browse to the shell script you saved.  Or upload a script from your computer.
1. Add command arguments as needed.

> [!TIP]
> If workspace storage is attached to a virtual network you might not be able to access the setup script file unless you are accessing the studio from within virtual network.

## Use the script in a Resource Manager template

In a Resource Manager [template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/machine-learning-compute-create-computeinstance), add `setupScripts` to invoke the setup script when the compute instance is provisioned. For example:

```json
"setupScripts":{
    "scripts":{
        "creationScript":{
        "scriptSource":"workspaceStorage",
        "scriptData":"[parameters('creationScript.location')]",
        "scriptArguments":"[parameters('creationScript.cmdArguments')]"
        }
    }
}
```

`scriptData` above specifies the location of the creation script in the notebooks file share such as `Users/admin/testscript.sh`.
`scriptArguments` is optional above and specifies the arguments for the creation script.

You could instead provide the script inline for a Resource Manager template.  The shell command can refer to any dependencies uploaded into the notebooks file share.  When you use an inline string, the working directory for the script is `/mnt/batch/tasks/shared/LS_root/mounts/clusters/**ciname**/code/Users`.

For example, specify a base64 encoded command string for `scriptData`:

```json
"setupScripts":{
    "scripts":{
        "creationScript":{
        "scriptSource":"inline",
        "scriptData":"[base64(parameters('inlineCommand'))]",
        "scriptArguments":"[parameters('creationScript.cmdArguments')]"
        }
    }
}
```

## Setup script logs

Logs from the setup script execution appear in the logs folder in the compute instance details page. Logs are stored back to your notebooks file share under the `Logs\<compute instance name>` folder. Script file and command arguments for a particular compute instance are shown in the details page.
