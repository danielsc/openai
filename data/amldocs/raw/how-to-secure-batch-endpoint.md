# Network isolation in batch endpoints

When deploying a machine learning model to a batch endpoint, you can secure their communication using private networks. This article explains the requirements to use batch endpoint in an environment secured by private networks.

## Prerequisites

* A secure Azure Machine Learning workspace. For more details about how to achieve it read [Create a secure workspace](tutorial-create-secure-workspace.md).
* For Azure Container Registry in private networks, please note that there are [some prerequisites about their configuration](how-to-secure-workspace-vnet.md#prerequisites).

    > [!WARNING]
    > Azure Container Registries with Quarantine feature enabled are not supported by the moment.

* Ensure blob, file, queue, and table private endpoints are configured for the storage accounts as explained at [Secure Azure storage accounts](how-to-secure-workspace-vnet.md#secure-azure-storage-accounts). Batch deployments require all the 4 to properly work.

## Securing batch endpoints

All the batch endpoints created inside of secure workspace are deployed as private batch endpoints by default. No further configuration is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When working on a private link-enabled workspaces, batch endpoints can be created and managed using Azure Machine Learning studio. However, they can't be invoked from the UI in studio. Please use the Azure ML CLI v2 instead for job creation. For more details about how to use it see [Invoke the batch endpoint to start a batch scoring job](how-to-use-batch-endpoint.md#invoke-the-batch-endpoint-to-start-a-batch-job).

The following diagram shows how the networking looks like for batch endpoints when deployed in a private workspace:

In order to enable the jump host VM (or self-hosted agent VMs if using [Azure Bastion](../bastion/bastion-overview.md)) access to the resources in Azure Machine Learning VNET, the previous architecture uses virtual network peering to seamlessly connect these two virtual networks. Thus the two virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between VMs and Azure Machine Learning resources in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. Like traffic between them in the same network, traffic is routed through Microsoft's private network only.

## Securing batch deployment jobs

Azure Machine Learning batch deployments run on compute clusters. To secure batch deployment jobs, those compute clusters have to be deployed in a virtual network too.

1. Create an Azure Machine Learning [computer cluster in the virtual network](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md).
2. Ensure all related services have private endpoints configured in the network. Private endpoints are used for not only Azure Machine Learning workspace, but also its associated resources such as Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, or Azure Container Registry. Azure Container Registry is a required service. While securing the Azure Machine Learning workspace with virtual networks, please note that there are [some prerequisites about Azure Container Registry](how-to-secure-workspace-vnet.md#prerequisites).
4. If your compute instance uses a public IP address, you must [Allow inbound communication](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md#compute-instancecluster-with-public-ip) so that management services can submit jobs to your compute resources.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Compute cluster and compute instance can be created with or without a public IP address. If created with a public IP address, you get a load balancer with a public IP to accept the inbound access from Azure batch service and Azure Machine Learning service. You need to configure User Defined Routing (UDR) if you use a firewall. If created without a public IP, you get a private link service to accept the inbound access from Azure batch service and Azure Machine Learning service without a public IP.

1. Extra NSG may be required depending on your case. For more information, see [How to secure your training environment](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md).

For more information, see the [Secure an Azure Machine Learning training environment with virtual networks](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md) article.

## Using two-networks architecture

There are cases where the input data is not in the same network as in the Azure Machine Learning resources. In those cases, your Azure Machine Learning workspace may need to interact with more than one VNet. You can achieve this configuration by adding an extra set of private endpoints to the VNet where the rest of the resources are located.

The following diagram shows the high level design:

### Considerations

Have the following considerations when using such architecture:

* Put the second set of private endpoints in a different resource group and hence in different private DNS zones. This prevents a name resolution conflict between the set of IPs used for the workspace and the ones used by the client VNets. Azure Private DNS provides a reliable, secure DNS service to manage and resolve domain names in a virtual network without the need to add a custom DNS solution. By using private DNS zones, you can use your own custom domain names rather than the Azure-provided names available today. Please note that the DNS resolution against a private DNS zone works only from virtual networks that are linked to it. For more details see [recommended zone names for Azure services](../private-link/private-endpoint-dns.md#azure-services-dns-zone-configuration).
* For your storage accounts, add 4 private endpoints in each VNet for blob, file, queue, and table as explained at [Secure Azure storage accounts](how-to-secure-workspace-vnet.md#secure-azure-storage-accounts).
