# Set up a Python development environment for Azure Machine Learning

Learn how to configure a Python development environment for Azure Machine Learning.

The following table shows each development environment covered in this article, along with pros and cons.

| Environment | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Local environment](#local-computer-or-remote-vm-environment) | Full control of your development environment and dependencies. Run with any build tool, environment, or IDE of your choice. | Takes longer to get started. Necessary SDK packages must be installed, and an environment must also be installed if you don't already have one. |
| [The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](#data-science-virtual-machine) | Similar to the cloud-based compute instance (Python is pre-installed), but with additional popular data science and machine learning tools pre-installed. Easy to scale and combine with other custom tools and workflows. | A slower getting started experience compared to the cloud-based compute instance. |
| [Azure Machine Learning compute instance](#azure-machine-learning-compute-instance) | Easiest way to get started. The SDK is already installed in your workspace VM, and notebook tutorials are pre-cloned and ready to run. | Lack of control over your development environment and dependencies. Additional cost incurred for Linux VM (VM can be stopped when not in use to avoid charges). See [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/). |
| [Azure Databricks](how-to-configure-databricks-automl-environment.md) | Ideal for running large-scale intensive machine learning workflows on the scalable Apache Spark platform. | Overkill for experimental machine learning, or smaller-scale experiments and workflows. Additional cost incurred for Azure Databricks. See [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/databricks/). |

This article also provides additional usage tips for the following tools:

* Jupyter Notebooks: If you're already using Jupyter Notebooks, the SDK has some extras that you should install.

* Visual Studio Code: If you use Visual Studio Code, the [Azure Machine Learning extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-ai) includes language support for Python, and features to make working with the Azure Machine Learning much more convenient and productive.

## Prerequisites

* Azure Machine Learning workspace. If you don't have one, you can create an Azure Machine Learning workspace through the [Azure portal](how-to-manage-workspace.md), [Azure CLI](how-to-manage-workspace-cli.md#create-a-workspace), and [Azure Resource Manager templates](how-to-create-workspace-template.md).

### Local and DSVM only: Create a workspace configuration file

The workspace configuration file is a JSON file that tells the SDK how to communicate with your Azure Machine Learning workspace. The file is named *config.json*, and it has the following format:

```json
{
    "subscription_id": "<subscription-id>",
    "resource_group": "<resource-group>",
    "workspace_name": "<workspace-name>"
}
```

This JSON file must be in the directory structure that contains your Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks. It can be in the same directory, a subdirectory named.azureml*, or in a parent directory.

To use this file from your code, use the [`MLClient.from_config`](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.mlclient#azure-ai-ml-mlclient-from-config) method. This code loads the information from the file and connects to your workspace.

Create a workspace configuration file in one of the following methods:

* Azure Machine Learning studio

    **Download the file**: 
    1. Sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com)
    1. In the upper right Azure Machine Learning studio toolbar, select your workspace name.
    1. Select the **Download config file** link.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-environment/configure.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to download your config file." lightbox="media/how-to-configure-environment/configure.png":::

* Azure Machine Learning Python SDK

    Create a script to connect to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. Make sure to replace `subscription_id`,`resource_group`, and `workspace_name` with your own.

    [!INCLUDE [sdk v2](../../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

    ```python
        #import required libraries
        from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
        from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

        #Enter details of your AzureML workspace
        subscription_id = '<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>'
        resource_group = '<RESOURCE_GROUP>'
        workspace = '<AZUREML_WORKSPACE_NAME>'
      
        #connect to the workspace
        ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)
    ```

## Local computer or remote VM environment

You can set up an environment on a local computer or remote virtual machine, such as an Azure Machine Learning compute instance or Data Science VM. 

To configure a local development environment or remote VM:

1. Create a Python virtual environment (virtualenv, conda).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Although not required, it's recommended you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to manage Python virtual environments and install packages.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're on Linux or macOS and use a shell other than bash (for example, zsh) you might receive errors when you run some commands. To work around this problem, use the `bash` command to start a new bash shell and run the commands there.

1. Activate your newly created Python virtual environment.
1. Install the [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-ml-readme).
1. To configure your local environment to use your Azure Machine Learning workspace, [create a workspace configuration file](#local-and-dsvm-only-create-a-workspace-configuration-file) or use an existing one.

Now that you have your local environment set up, you're ready to start working with Azure Machine Learning. See the [Tutorial: Azure Machine Learning in a day](tutorial-azure-ml-in-a-day.md) to get started.

### Jupyter Notebooks

When running a local Jupyter Notebook server, it's recommended that you create an IPython kernel for your Python virtual environment. This helps ensure the expected kernel and package import behavior.

1. Enable environment-specific IPython kernels

    ```bash
    conda install notebook ipykernel
    ```

1. Create a kernel for your Python virtual environment. Make sure to replace `<myenv>` with the name of your Python virtual environment.

    ```bash
    ipython kernel install --user --name <myenv> --display-name "Python (myenv)"
    ```

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server

    > [!TIP]
    For example notebooks, see the [AzureML-Examples](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) repository. SDK examples are located under [/sdk/python](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/sdk/python). For example, the [Configuration notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/jobs/configuration.ipynb) example.

### Visual Studio Code

To use Visual Studio Code for development:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
1. Install the [Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension](how-to-setup-vs-code.md) (preview).

Once you have the Visual Studio Code extension installed, use it to:

* [Manage your Azure Machine Learning resources](how-to-manage-resources-vscode.md)
* [Connect to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md)
* [Run and debug experiments](how-to-debug-visual-studio-code.md)
* [Deploy trained models](tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode.md).

## Azure Machine Learning compute instance

The Azure Machine Learning [compute instance](concept-compute-instance.md) is a secure, cloud-based Azure workstation that provides data scientists with a Jupyter Notebook server, JupyterLab, and a fully managed machine learning environment.

There's nothing to install or configure for a compute instance.  

Create one anytime from within your Azure Machine Learning workspace. Provide just a name and specify an Azure VM type. Try it now with this [Tutorial: Setup environment and workspace](quickstart-create-resources.md).

To learn more about compute instances, including how to install packages, see [Create and manage an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](how-to-create-manage-compute-instance.md).

> [!TIP]
> To prevent incurring charges for an unused compute instance, [enable idle shutdown](how-to-create-manage-compute-instance.md#enable-idle-shutdown-preview).

In addition to a Jupyter Notebook server and JupyterLab, you can use compute instances in the [integrated notebook feature inside of Azure Machine Learning studio](how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks.md).

You can also use the Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension to [connect to a remote compute instance using VS Code](how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md).

## Data Science Virtual Machine

The Data Science VM is a customized virtual machine (VM) image you can use as a development environment. It's designed for data science work that's pre-configured tools and software like:

  - Packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and the Azure Machine Learning SDK
  - Popular data science tools such as Spark Standalone and Drill
  - Azure tools such as the Azure CLI, AzCopy, and Storage Explorer
  - Integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code and PyCharm
  - Jupyter Notebook Server

For a more comprehensive list of the tools, see the [Data Science VM tools guide](data-science-virtual-machine/tools-included.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you plan to use the Data Science VM as a [compute target](concept-compute-target.md) for your training or inferencing jobs, only Ubuntu is supported.

To use the Data Science VM as a development environment:

1. Create a Data Science VM using one of the following methods:

    * Use the Azure portal to create an [Ubuntu](data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro.md) or [Windows](data-science-virtual-machine/provision-vm.md) DSVM.
    * [Create a Data Science VM using ARM templates](data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-tutorial-resource-manager.md).
    * Use the Azure CLI

        To create an Ubuntu Data Science VM, use the following command:

        ```azurecli-interactive
        # create a Ubuntu Data Science VM in your resource group
        # note you need to be at least a contributor to the resource group in order to execute this command successfully
        # If you need to create a new resource group use: "az group create --name YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME --location YOUR-REGION (For example: westus2)"
        az vm create --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME --name YOUR-VM-NAME --image microsoft-dsvm:linux-data-science-vm-ubuntu:linuxdsvmubuntu:latest --admin-username YOUR-USERNAME --admin-password YOUR-PASSWORD --generate-ssh-keys --authentication-type password
        ```

        To create a Windows DSVM, use the following command:

        ```azurecli-interactive
        # create a Windows Server 2016 DSVM in your resource group
        # note you need to be at least a contributor to the resource group in order to execute this command successfully
        az vm create --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME --name YOUR-VM-NAME --image microsoft-dsvm:dsvm-windows:server-2016:latest --admin-username YOUR-USERNAME --admin-password YOUR-PASSWORD --authentication-type password
        ```

1. Create a conda environment for the Azure Machine Learning SDK:

    ```bash
    conda create -n py310 python=310
    ```

1. Once the environment has been created, activate it and install the SDK

    ```bash
    conda activate py310
    pip install azure-ai-ml
    ``` 

1. To configure the Data Science VM to use your Azure Machine Learning workspace, [create a workspace configuration file](#local-and-dsvm-only-create-a-workspace-configuration-file) or use an existing one.

    > [!TIP]
    > Similar to local environments, you can use Visual Studio Code and the [Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension](#visual-studio-code) to interact with Azure Machine Learning.
