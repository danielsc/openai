# Azure Machine Learning feature availability across clouds regions

Learn what Azure Machine Learning features are available in the Azure Government, Azure Germany, and Azure China 21Vianet regions. 

In the list of global Azure regions, there are several regions that serve specific markets in addition to the public cloud regions. For example, the Azure Government and the Azure China 21Vianet regions. Azure Machine Learning is deployed into the following regions, in addition to public cloud regions:

* Azure Government regions **US-Arizona** and **US-Virginia**.
* Azure China 21Vianet region **China-East-2**.

Azure Machine Learning is still in development in air-gap Regions. 

The information in the rest of this document provides information on what features of Azure Machine Learning are available in these regions, along with region-specific information on using these features.

### Other Azure Government limitations

* For Azure Machine Learning compute instances, the ability to refresh a token lasting more than 24 hours is not available in Azure Government.
* Model Profiling does not support 4 CPUs in the US-Arizona region.   
* Sample notebooks may not work in Azure Government if it needs access to public data.
* IP addresses: The CLI command used in the [required public internet access](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md#required-public-internet-access-to-train-models) instructions does not return IP ranges. Use the [Azure IP ranges and service tags for Azure Government](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57063) instead.
* For scheduled pipelines, we also provide a blob-based trigger mechanism. This mechanism is not supported for CMK workspaces. For enabling a blob-based trigger for CMK workspaces, you have to do extra setup. For more information, see [Trigger a run of a machine learning pipeline from a Logic App (SDK/CLI v1)](v1/how-to-trigger-published-pipeline.md).
* Firewalls: When using an Azure Government region, add the following hosts to your firewall setting:

    * For Arizona use: `usgovarizona.api.ml.azure.us`
    * For Virginia use: `usgovvirginia.api.ml.azure.us`
    * For both: `graph.windows.net`

### Other Azure China limitations

* Azure China has limited VM SKU, especially for GPU SKU. It only has NCv3 family (V100).
* REST API Endpoints are different from global Azure. Use the following table to find the REST API endpoint for Azure China regions:

    | REST endpoint                 | Global Azure                                 | China-Government                           |
    |------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | Management plane | `https://management.azure.com/`              | `https://management.chinacloudapi.cn/`       |
    | Data plane       | `https://{location}.experiments.azureml.net` | `https://{location}.experiments.ml.azure.cn` |
    | Azure Active Directory              | `https://login.microsoftonline.com`          | `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn`             |

* Sample notebook may not work, if it needs access to public data.
* IP address ranges: The CLI command used in the [required public internet access](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md#required-public-internet-access-to-train-models) instructions does not return IP ranges. Use the [Azure IP ranges and service tags for Azure China](https://www.microsoft.com//download/details.aspx?id=57062) instead.
* Azure Machine Learning compute instances preview is not supported in a workspace where Private Endpoint is enabled for now, but CI will be supported in the next deployment for the service expansion to all AzureML regions.
* Searching for assets in the web UI with Chinese characters will not work correctly.
