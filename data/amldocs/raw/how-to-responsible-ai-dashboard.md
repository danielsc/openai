# Use the Responsible AI dashboard in Azure Machine Learning studio

Responsible AI dashboards are linked to your registered models. To view your Responsible AI dashboard, go into your model registry and select the registered model you've generated a Responsible AI dashboard for. Then, select the **Responsible AI** tab to view a list of generated dashboards.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/view-responsible-ai-model-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the model details pane in Azure Machine Learning studio, with the 'Responsible AI' tab highlighted." lightbox= "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/view-responsible-ai-model-page.png":::

You can configure multiple dashboards and attach them to your registered model. Various combinations of components (interpretability, error analysis, causal analysis, and so on) can be attached to each Responsible AI dashboard. The following image displays a dashboard's customization and the components that were generated within it. In each dashboard, you can view or hide various components within the dashboard UI itself.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/view-responsible-ai-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Responsible AI tab with a dashboard name highlighted." lightbox = "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/view-responsible-ai-dashboard.png":::

Select the name of the dashboard to open it into a full view in your browser. To return to your list of dashboards, you can select **Back to models details** at any time.

## Full functionality with integrated compute resource

Some features of the Responsible AI dashboard require dynamic, on-the-fly, and real-time computation (for example, what-if analysis). Unless you connect a compute resource to the dashboard, you might find some functionality missing. When you connect to a compute resource, you enable full functionality of your Responsible AI dashboard for the following components:

- **Error analysis**
    - Setting your global data cohort to any cohort of interest will update the error tree instead of disabling it.
    - Selecting other error or performance metrics is supported.
    - Selecting any subset of features for training the error tree map is supported.
    - Changing the minimum number of samples required per leaf node and error tree depth is supported.
    - Dynamically updating the heat map for up to two features is supported.
- **Feature importance**
    - An individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot in the individual feature importance tab is supported.
- **Counterfactual what-if**
    - Generating a new what-if counterfactual data point to understand the minimum change required for a desired outcome is supported.
- **Causal analysis**
    - Selecting any individual data point, perturbing its treatment features, and seeing the expected causal outcome of causal what-if is supported (only for regression machine learning scenarios).

You can also find this information on the Responsible AI dashboard page by selecting the **Information** icon, as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-view-full-functionality.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Information' icon on the Responsible AI dashboard.":::

### Enable full functionality of the Responsible AI dashboard

1. Select a running compute instance in the **Compute** dropdown list at the top of the dashboard. If you donâ€™t have a running compute, create a new compute instance by selecting the plus sign (**+**) next to the dropdown. Or you can select the **Start compute** button to start a stopped compute instance. Creating or starting a compute instance might take few minutes.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/select-compute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Compute' dropdown box for selecting a running compute instance." lightbox = "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/select-compute.png":::
    
2. When a compute is in a *Running* state, your Responsible AI dashboard starts to connect to the compute instance. To achieve this, a terminal process is created on the selected compute instance, and a Responsible AI endpoint is started on the terminal. Select **View terminal outputs** to view the current terminal process.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-connect-terminal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the responsible AI dashboard is connecting to a compute resource." lightbox = "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-connect-terminal.png":::

3. When your Responsible AI dashboard is connected to the compute instance, you'll see a green message bar, and the dashboard is now fully functional.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the dashboard is connected to the compute instance." lightbox= "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-connected.png":::

4. If the process takes a while and your Responsible AI dashboard is still not connected to the compute instance, or a red error message bar is displayed, it means there are issues with starting your Responsible AI endpoint. Select **View terminal outputs** and scroll down to the bottom to view the error message.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an error connecting to a compute." lightbox ="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-error.png":::

    If you're having difficulty figuring out how to resolve the "failed to connect to compute instance" issue, select the **Smile** icon at the upper right. Submit feedback to us about any error or issue you encounter. You can include a screenshot and your email address in the feedback form.

5. **Feature importance of [feature] (regression) or Feature importance of [feature] on [predicted class] (classification)**: Plots the importance of a particular feature across the predictions. For regression scenarios, the importance values are in terms of the output, so positive feature importance means it contributed positively toward the output. The opposite applies to negative feature importance.  For classification scenarios, positive feature importances mean that feature value is contributing toward the predicted class denoted in the y-axis title. Negative feature importance means it's contributing against the predicted class.
6. **View dependence plot for**: Selects the feature whose importances you want to plot.
7. **Select a dataset cohort**: Selects the cohort whose importances you want to plot.

#### Individual feature importances (local explanations)

2. **Recommended global treatment policy**: Displays recommended interventions for data cohorts to improve the target feature value. The table can be read from left to right, where the segmentation of the dataset is first in rows and then in columns. For example, for 658 individuals whose employer isn't Snapchat and whose programming language isn't JavaScript, the recommended treatment policy is to increase the number of GitHub repos contributed to.

    **Average gains of alternative policies over always applying treatment**: Plots the target feature value in a bar chart of the average gain in your outcome for the above recommended treatment policy versus always applying treatment.

3. **Show top k data point samples ordered by causal effects for recommended treatment feature**: Selects the number of data points to show in the table.

4. **Recommended individual treatment policy table**: Lists, in descending order of causal effect, the data points whose target features would be most improved by an intervention.
