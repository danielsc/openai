# Reference for configuring Kubernetes cluster for Azure Machine Learning

This article contains reference information that may be useful when [configuring Kubernetes with Azure Machine Learning](./how-to-attach-kubernetes-anywhere.md).


## Supported Kubernetes version and region


- Kubernetes clusters installing AzureML extension have a version support window of "N-2", that is aligned with [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) version support policy](../aks/supported-kubernetes-versions.md#kubernetes-version-support-policy), where 'N' is the latest GA minor version of Azure Kubernetes Service.

  - For example, if AKS introduces 1.20.a today, versions 1.20.a, 1.20.b, 1.19.c, 1.19.d, 1.18.e, and 1.18.f are supported.

  - If customers are running an unsupported Kubernetes version, they'll be asked to upgrade when requesting support for the cluster. Clusters running unsupported Kubernetes releases aren't covered by the AzureML extension support policies.
- AzureML extension region availability: 
  - AzureML extension can be deployed to AKS or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes in supported regions listed in [Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes region support](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=azure-arc&regions=all).

## Recommended resource planning

When you deploy the AzureML extension, some related services will be deployed to your Kubernetes cluster for Azure Machine Learning. The following table lists the **Related Services and their resource usage** in the cluster:

|Deploy/Daemonset |Replica # |Training |Inference|CPU Request(m) |CPU Limit(m)| Memory Request(Mi) | Memory Limit(Mi) |

Excluding your own deployments/pods, the **total minimum system resources requirements** are as follows:

|Scenario | Enabled Inference | Enabled Training | CPU Request(m) |CPU Limit(m)| Memory Request(Mi) | Memory Limit(Mi) | Node count | Recommended minimum VM size | Corresponding AKS VM SKU |
|-- |-- |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|

> [!NOTE]
> 
> * For **test purpose**, you should refer tp the resource **request**. 
> * For **production purpose**, you should refer to the resource **limit**.


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Here are some other considerations for reference:
> * For **higher network bandwidth and better disk I/O performance**, we recommend a larger SKU. 
>     * Take [DV2/DSv2](../virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series.md#dsv2-series) as example, using the large SKU can reduce the time of pulling image for better network/storage performance. 
>     * More information about AKS reservation can be found in [AKS reservation](../aks/concepts-clusters-workloads.md#resource-reservations).
> * If you are using AKS cluster, you may need to consider about the **size limit on a container image** in AKS, more information you can found in [AKS container image size limit](../aks/faq.md#what-is-the-size-limit-on-a-container-image-in-aks).

## Prerequisites for ARO or OCP clusters
### Disable Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) 

[AzureML dataset](v1/how-to-train-with-datasets.md) (an SDK v1 feature used in AzureML training jobs) isn't supported on machines with SELinux enabled. Therefore, you need to disable `selinux`  on all workers in order to use AzureML dataset.

### Privileged setup for ARO and OCP

For AzureML extension deployment on ARO or OCP cluster, grant privileged access to AzureML service accounts, run ```oc edit scc privileged``` command, and add following service accounts under "users:":

* ```system:serviceaccount:azure-arc:azure-arc-kube-aad-proxy-sa```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:{EXTENSION-NAME}-kube-state-metrics``` 
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:prom-admission```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:default```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:prom-operator```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:load-amlarc-selinux-policy-sa```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:azureml-fe-v2```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:prom-prometheus```
* ```system:serviceaccount:{KUBERNETES-COMPUTE-NAMESPACE}:default```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:azureml-ingress-nginx```
* ```system:serviceaccount:azureml:azureml-ingress-nginx-admission```

> [!NOTE]
> * `{EXTENSION-NAME}`: is the extension name specified with the `az k8s-extension create --name` CLI command. 
>* `{KUBERNETES-COMPUTE-NAMESPACE}`: is the namespace of the Kubernetes compute specified when attaching the compute to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Skip configuring `system:serviceaccount:{KUBERNETES-COMPUTE-NAMESPACE}:default` if `KUBERNETES-COMPUTE-NAMESPACE` is `default`.

## Collected log details

Some logs about AzureML workloads in the cluster will be collected through extension components, such as status, metrics, life cycle, etc. The following list shows all the log details collected, including the type of logs collected and where they were sent to or stored.

|Pod  |Resource description |Detail logging info |
|--|--|--|
|amlarc-identity-controller	|Request and renew Azure Blob/Azure Container Registry token through managed identity.	|Only used when `enableInference=true` is set when installing the extension. It has trace logs for status on getting identity for endpoints to authenticate with AzureML service.|
|amlarc-identity-proxy	|Request and renew Azure Blob/Azure Container Registry token through managed identity.	|Only used when `enableInference=true` is set when installing the extension. It has trace logs for status on getting identity for the cluster to authenticate with AzureML service.|
|aml-operator	| Manage the lifecycle of training jobs.	|The logs contain AzureML training job pod status in the cluster.|
|azureml-fe-v2|	The front-end component that routes incoming inference requests to deployed services.	|Access logs at request level, including request ID, start time, response code, error details and durations for request latency. Trace logs for service metadata changes, service running healthy status, etc. for debugging purpose.|
| gateway	| The gateway is used to communicate and send data back and forth.	| Trace logs on requests from AzureML services to the clusters.|
|healthcheck	|--| 	The logs contain azureml namespace resource (AzureML extension) status to diagnose what make the extension not functional. |
|inference-operator-controller-manager|	Manage the lifecycle of inference endpoints.	|The logs contain AzureML inference endpoint and deployment pod status in the cluster.|
| metrics-controller-manager	| Manage the configuration for Prometheus.|Trace logs for status of uploading training job and inference  deployment metrics on CPU utilization and memory utilization.|
| relay server	| relay server is only needed in arc-connected cluster and will not be installed in AKS cluster.| Relay server works with Azure Relay to communicate with the cloud services.	The logs contain request level info from Azure relay.  |
 	

## AzureML jobs connect with custom data storage

[Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) are Kubernetes concept, allowing user to provide and consume various storage resources. 

1. Create PV, take NFS as example,

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv 
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi 
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany 
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: ""
  nfs: 
    path: /share/nfs
    server: 20.98.110.84 
    readOnly: false
```
2. Create PVC in the same Kubernetes namespace with ML workloads. In `metadata`, you **must** add label `ml.azure.com/pvc: "true"` to be recognized by AzureML, and add annotation  `ml.azure.com/mountpath: <mount path>` to set the mount path. 

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc  
  namespace: default
  labels:
    ml.azure.com/pvc: "true"
  annotations:
    ml.azure.com/mountpath: "/mnt/nfs"
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany      
  resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the job pods in the same Kubernetes namespace with the PVC(s) will be mounted the volume. Data scientist is able to access the `mount path` specified in the PVC annotation in the job.


## Supported AzureML taints and tolerations

[Taint and Toleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) are Kubernetes concepts that work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. 

Kubernetes clusters integrated with Azure Machine Learning (including AKS and Arc Kubernetes clusters) now support specific AzureML taints and tolerations, allowing users to add specific AzureML taints on the AzureML-dedicated nodes, to prevent non-AzureML workloads from being scheduled onto these dedicated nodes.

We only support placing the amlarc-specific taints on your nodes, which are defined as follows: 

| Taint | Key | Value | Effect | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| amlarc overall| ml.azure.com/amlarc	| true| `NoSchddule`, `NoExecute`  or `PreferNoSchedule`| All Azureml workloads, including extension system service pods and machine learning workload pods would tolerate this `amlarc overall` taint.|
| amlarc system | ml.azure.com/amlarc-system |true	| `NoSchddule`, `NoExecute`  or `PreferNoSchedule`| Only Azureml extension system services pods would tolerate this `amlarc system` taint.|
| amlarc workload| 	ml.azure.com/amlarc-workload |true| `NoSchddule`, `NoExecute`  or `PreferNoSchedule`| Only machine learning workload pods would tolerate this `amlarc workload` taint. |
| amlarc resource group| 	ml.azure.com/resource-group | \<resource group name> | `NoSchddule`, `NoExecute`  or `PreferNoSchedule`| Only machine learning workload pods created from the specific resource group would tolerate this `amlarc resource group` taint.|
| amlarc workspace | 	ml.azure.com/workspace |	\<workspace name>	| `NoSchddule`, `NoExecute`  or `PreferNoSchedule`|Only machine learning workload pods created from the specific workspace would tolerate this `amlarc workspace` taint. |
| amlarc compute| 	ml.azure.com/compute| \<compute name>	| `NoSchddule`, `NoExecute`  or `PreferNoSchedule`| Only machine learning workload pods created with the specific compute target would tolerate this `amlarc compute` taint.|

> [!TIP]
> 1. For Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS), you can follow the example in [Best practices for advanced scheduler features in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks/operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler.md#provide-dedicated-nodes-using-taints-and-tolerations) to apply taints to node pools.
> 1. For Arc Kubernetes clusters, such as on premises Kubernetes clusters, you can use `kubectl taint` command to add taints to nodes. For more examples,see the [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).

### Best practices

According to your scheduling requirements of the Azureml-dedicated nodes, you can add **multiple amlarc-specific taints** to restrict what Azureml workloads can run on nodes. We list best practices for using amlarc taints:

- **To prevent non-azureml workloads from running on azureml-dedicated nodes/node pools**, you can just add the `aml overall` taint to these nodes.
- **To prevent non-system pods from running on azureml-dedicated nodes/node pools**, you have to add the following taints: 
  - `amlarc overall` taint
  - `amlarc system` taint
- **To prevent non-ml workloads from running on azureml-dedicated nodes/node pools**, you have to add the following taints: 
  - `amlarc overall` taint
  - `amlarc workloads` taint
- **To prevent workloads not created from *workspace X* from running on azureml-dedicated nodes/node pools**, you have to add the following taints: 
  - `amlarc overall` taint
  - `amlarc resource group (has this <workspace X>)` taint 
  - `amlarc <workspace X>` taint
- **To prevent workloads not created by *compute target X* from running on azureml-dedicated nodes/node pools**, you have to add the following taints: 
  - `amlarc overall` taint
  - `amlarc resource group (has this <workspace X>)` taint 
  - `amlarc workspace (has this <compute X>)` taint
  - `amlarc <compute X>` taint

  
## Integrate other load balancers with AzureML extension over HTTP or HTTPS

In addition to the default AzureML inference load balancer [azureml-fe](../machine-learning/how-to-kubernetes-inference-routing-azureml-fe.md), you can also integrate other load balancers with AzureML extension over HTTP or HTTPS. 

This tutorial helps illustrate how to integrate the [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) or the [Azure Application Gateway](../application-gateway/overview.md).

### Prerequisites

- [Deploy the AzureML extension](../machine-learning/how-to-deploy-kubernetes-extension.md) with `inferenceRouterServiceType=ClusterIP` and `allowInsecureConnections=True`, so that the Nginx Ingress Controller can handle TLS termination by itself instead of handing it over to [azureml-fe](../machine-learning/how-to-kubernetes-inference-routing-azureml-fe.md) when service is exposed over HTTPS.
- For integrating with **Nginx Ingress Controller**, you will need a Kubernetes cluster setup with Nginx Ingress Controller.
  - [**Create a basic controller**](../aks/ingress-basic.md): If you are starting from scratch, refer to these instructions.
- For integrating with **Azure Application Gateway**, you will need a Kubernetes cluster setup with Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller.
  - [**Greenfield Deployment**](../application-gateway/tutorial-ingress-controller-add-on-new.md): If you are starting from scratch, refer to these instructions.
  - [**Brownfield Deployment**](../application-gateway/tutorial-ingress-controller-add-on-existing.md): If you have an existing AKS cluster and Application Gateway, refer to these instructions.
- If you want to use HTTPS on this application, you will need a x509 certificate and its private key.

### Expose services over HTTP

In order to expose the azureml-fe, we will use the following ingress resource:

```yaml
# Nginx Ingress Controller example
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: azureml-fe
  namespace: azureml
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: azureml-fe
            port:
              number: 80
        pathType: Prefix
```
This ingress will expose the `azureml-fe` service and the selected deployment as a default backend of the Nginx Ingress Controller.



```yaml
# Azure Application Gateway example
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: azureml-fe
  namespace: azureml
spec:
  ingressClassName: azure-application-gateway
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: azureml-fe
            port:
              number: 80
        pathType: Prefix
```
This ingress will expose the `azureml-fe` service and the selected deployment as a default backend of the Application Gateway.

Save the above ingress resource as `ing-azureml-fe.yaml`.

1. Deploy `ing-azureml-fe.yaml` by running:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ing-azureml-fe.yaml
    ```

2. Check the log of the ingress controller for deployment status.

3. Now the `azureml-fe` application should be available. You can check this by visiting:
    - **Nginx Ingress Controller**: the public LoadBalancer address of Nginx Ingress Controller 
    - **Azure Application Gateway**: the public address of the Application Gateway.
4. [Create an inference job and invoke](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/blob/master/docs/simple-flow.md).

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Replace the ip in scoring_uri with public LoadBalancer address of the Nginx Ingress Controller before invoking.

### Expose services over HTTPS

1. Before deploying ingress, you need to create a kubernetes secret to host the certificate and private key. You can create a kubernetes secret by running

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret tls <ingress-secret-name> -n azureml --key <path-to-key> --cert <path-to-cert>
    ```

2. Define the following ingress. In the ingress, specify the name of the secret in the `secretName` section.

    ```yaml
    # Nginx Ingress Controller example
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: azureml-fe
      namespace: azureml
    spec:
      ingressClassName: nginx
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <ingress-secret-name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: azureml-fe
                port:
                  number: 80
            pathType: Prefix
    ```

    ```yaml
    # Azure Application Gateway example
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: azureml-fe
      namespace: azureml
    spec:
      ingressClassName: azure-application-gateway
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <ingress-secret-name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: azureml-fe
                port:
                  number: 80
            pathType: Prefix
    ```

    >[!NOTE] 
    >
    > Replace `<domain>` and `<ingress-secret-name>` in the above Ingress Resource with the domain pointing to LoadBalancer of the **Nginx ingress controller/Application Gateway** and name of your secret. Store the above Ingress Resource in a file name `ing-azureml-fe-tls.yaml`.

1. Deploy ing-azureml-fe-tls.yaml by running

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ing-azureml-fe-tls.yaml
    ```

2. Check the log of the ingress controller for deployment status.

3. Now the `azureml-fe` application will be available on HTTPS. You can check this by visiting the public LoadBalancer address of the Nginx Ingress Controller.

4. [Create an inference job and invoke](../machine-learning/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints.md).

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Replace the protocol and IP in scoring_uri with https and domain pointing to LoadBalancer of the Nginx Ingress Controller  or the Application Gateway before invoking.

## Use ARM Template to Deploy Extension
Extension on managed cluster can be deployed with ARM template. A sample template can be found from [deployextension.json](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/blob/master/files/deployextension.json), with a demo parameter file [deployextension.parameters.json](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/blob/master/files/deployextension.parameters.json) 

To leverage the sample deployment template, edit the parameter file with correct value, then run the following command:

```azurecli
az deployment group create --name <ARM deployment name> --resource-group <resource group name> --template-file deployextension.json --parameters deployextension.parameters.json
```
More information about how to use ARM template can be found from [ARM template doc](../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md)
