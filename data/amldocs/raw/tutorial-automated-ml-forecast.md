# Tutorial: Forecast demand with no-code automated machine learning in the Azure Machine Learning studio

Learn how to create a [time-series forecasting model](concept-automated-ml.md#time-series-forecasting) without writing a single line of code using automated machine learning in the Azure Machine Learning studio. This model will predict rental demand for a bike sharing service.  

You won't write any code in this tutorial, you'll use the studio interface to perform training.  You'll learn how to do the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and load a dataset.
> * Configure and run an automated ML experiment.
> * Specify forecasting settings.
> * Explore the experiment results.
> * Deploy the best model.

Also try automated machine learning for these other model types:

* For a no-code example of a classification model, see [Tutorial: Create a classification model with automated ML in Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md).
* For a code first example of an object detection model, see the [Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure Machine Learning workspace. See [Create workspace resources](quickstart-create-resources.md). 

* Download the [bike-no.csv](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/v1/python-sdk/tutorials/automl-with-azureml/forecasting-bike-share/bike-no.csv) data file

## Sign in to the studio

For this tutorial, you create your automated ML experiment run in Azure Machine Learning studio, a consolidated web interface that includes machine learning tools to perform data science scenarios for data science practitioners of all skill levels. The studio is not supported on Internet Explorer browsers.

1. Sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

1. Select your subscription and the workspace you created.

1. Select **Get started**.

1. In the left pane, select **Automated ML** under the **Author** section.

1. Select **+New automated ML job**. 

## Create and load dataset

Before you configure your experiment, upload your data file to your workspace in the form of an Azure Machine Learning dataset. Doing so, allows you to ensure that your data is formatted appropriately for your experiment.

1. On the **Select dataset** form, select **From local files** from the  **+Create dataset** drop-down. 

    1. On the **Basic info** form, give your dataset a name and provide an optional description. The dataset type  should default to **Tabular**, since automated ML in Azure Machine Learning studio currently only supports tabular datasets.
    
    1. Select **Next** on the bottom left

    1. On the **Datastore and file selection** form, select the default datastore that was automatically set up during your workspace creation, **workspaceblobstore (Azure Blob Storage)**. This is the storage location where you'll upload your data file. 

    1. Select **Upload files** from the **Upload** drop-down.. 
    
    1. Choose the **bike-no.csv** file on your local computer. This is the file you downloaded as a [prerequisite](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/v1/python-sdk/tutorials/automl-with-azureml/forecasting-bike-share/bike-no.csv).

    1. Select **Next**

       When the upload is complete, the Settings and preview form is pre-populated based on the file type. 
       
    1. Verify that the **Settings and preview** form is populated as follows and select **Next**.
        
        Field|Description| Value for tutorial
        ---|---|---
        File format|Defines the layout and type of data stored in a file.| Delimited
        Delimiter|One or more characters for specifying the boundary between&nbsp; separate, independent regions in plain text or other data streams. |Comma
        Encoding|Identifies what bit to character schema table to use to read your dataset.| UTF-8
        Column headers| Indicates how the headers of the dataset, if any, will be treated.| Only first file has headers
        Skip rows | Indicates how many, if any, rows are skipped in the dataset.| None

    1. The **Schema** form allows for further configuration of your data for this experiment. 
    
        1. For this example, choose to ignore the **casual** and **registered** columns. These columns are a breakdown of the  **cnt** column so, therefore we don't include them.

        1. Also for this example, leave the defaults for the **Properties** and **Type**. 
        
        1. Select **Next**.

    1. On the **Confirm details** form, verify the information matches what was previously  populated on the **Basic info** and **Settings and preview** forms.

    1. Select **Create** to complete the creation of your dataset.

    1. Select your dataset once it appears in the list.

    1. Select  **Next**.

## Configure job

After you load and configure your data, set up your remote compute target and select which column in your data you want to predict.

1. Populate the **Configure job** form as follows:
    1. Enter an experiment name: `automl-bikeshare`

    1. Select **cnt** as the target column, what you want to predict. This column indicates the number of total bike share rentals.

    1. Select **compute cluster** as your compute type. 

    1. Select **+New** to configure your compute target. Automated ML only supports Azure Machine Learning compute. 

        1. Populate the **Select virtual machine** form to set up your compute.

        1. After creation, select your new compute target from the drop-down list.

    1. Select **Next**.

## Select forecast settings

Complete the setup for your automated ML experiment by specifying the machine learning task type and configuration settings.

1. On the **Task type and settings** form, select **Time series forecasting** as the machine learning task type.

1. Select **date** as your **Time column** and leave **Time series identifiers** blank. 

1. The **Frequency** is how often your historic data is collected. Keep **Autodetect** selected. 
1.
1. The **forecast horizon** is the length of time into the future you want to predict.  Deselect **Autodetect** and type 14 in the field. 

1. Select **View additional configuration settings** and populate the fields as follows. These settings are to better control the training job and specify settings for your forecast. Otherwise, defaults are applied based on experiment selection and data.

    Additional&nbsp;configurations|Description|Value&nbsp;for&nbsp;tutorial
    ------|---------|---
    Primary metric| Evaluation metric that the machine learning algorithm will be measured by.|Normalized root mean squared error

    Select **Save**.

1. Select **Next**.
    
1. On the **[Optional] Validate and test** form, 
    1. Select k-fold cross-validation as your **Validation type**.
    1.  Select 5 as your **Number of cross validations**.

## Run experiment

To run your experiment, select **Finish**. The **Job details**  screen opens with the **Job status** at the top next to the job number. This status updates as the experiment progresses. Notifications also appear in the top right corner of the studio, to inform you of the status of your experiment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Preparation takes **10-15 minutes** to prepare the experiment job.
> Once running, it takes **2-3 minutes more for each iteration**.<br> <br>
> In production, you'd likely walk away for a bit as this process takes time. While you wait, we suggest you start exploring the tested algorithms on the **Models** tab as they complete. 

##  Explore models

Navigate to the **Models** tab to see the algorithms (models) tested. By default, the models are ordered by metric score as they complete. For this tutorial, the model that scores the highest based on the chosen **Normalized root mean squared error** metric is at the top of the list.

While you wait for all of the experiment models to finish, select the **Algorithm name** of a completed model to explore its performance details. 

The following example navigates through the **Details** and the **Metrics** tabs to view the selected model's properties, metrics and performance charts.

## Deploy the model

Automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning studio allows you to deploy the best model as a web service in a few steps. Deployment is the integration of the model so it can predict on new data and identify potential areas of opportunity. 

For this experiment, deployment to a web service means that the bike share company now has an iterative and scalable web solution for forecasting bike share rental demand. 

Once the job is complete, navigate back to parent job page by selecting **Job 1** at the top of your screen.

In the **Best model summary** section, the best model in the context of this experiment, is selected based on the **Normalized root mean squared error metric.** 

We deploy this model, but be advised, deployment takes about 20 minutes to complete. The deployment process entails several steps including registering the model, generating resources, and configuring them for the web service.

1. Select **the best model** to open the model-specific page.

1. Select the **Deploy** button located in the top-left area of the screen.

1. Populate the **Deploy a model** pane as follows:

    Field| Value
    ----|----
    Deployment name| bikeshare-deploy
    Deployment description| bike share demand deployment
    Compute type | Select Azure Compute Instance (ACI)
    Enable authentication| Disable. 
    Use custom deployment assets| Disable. Disabling allows for the default driver file (scoring script) and environment file to be autogenerated. 
    
    For this example, we use the defaults provided in the *Advanced* menu. 

1. Select **Deploy**.  

    A green success message appears at the top of the **Job** screen stating that the deployment was started successfully. The progress of the deployment can be found in the **Model summary** pane under **Deploy status**.
    
Once deployment succeeds, you have an operational web service to generate predictions. 

Proceed to the [**Next steps**](#next-steps) to learn more about how to consume your new web service, and test your predictions using Power BI's built in Azure Machine Learning support.

## Clean up resources

Deployment files are larger than data and experiment files, so they cost more to store. Delete only the deployment files to minimize costs to your account, or if you want to keep your workspace and experiment files. Otherwise, delete the entire resource group, if you don't plan to use any of the files.  

### Delete the deployment instance

Delete just the deployment instance from the Azure Machine Learning studio, if you want to keep the resource group and workspace for other tutorials and exploration. 

1. Go to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/). Navigate to your workspace and  on the left under the **Assets** pane, select **Endpoints**. 

1. Select the deployment you want to delete and select **Delete**. 

1. Select **Proceed**.

### Delete the resource group
