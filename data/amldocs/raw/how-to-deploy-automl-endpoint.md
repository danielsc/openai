# How to deploy an AutoML model to an online endpoint

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](../../includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

In this article, you'll learn how to deploy an AutoML-trained machine learning model to an online (real-time inference) endpoint. Automated machine learning, also referred to as automated ML or AutoML, is the process of automating the time-consuming, iterative tasks of developing a machine learning model. For more, see [What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?](concept-automated-ml.md).

In this article you'll know how to deploy AutoML trained machine learning model to online endpoints using: 

- Azure Machine Learning studio
- Azure Machine Learning CLI v2
- Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2

## Prerequisites

An AutoML-trained machine learning model. For more, see [Tutorial: Train a classification model with no-code AutoML in the Azure Machine Learning studio](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md) or [Tutorial: Forecast demand with automated machine learning](tutorial-automated-ml-forecast.md).

## Deploy from Azure Machine Learning studio and no code

Deploying an AutoML-trained model from the Automated ML page is a no-code experience. That is, you don't need to prepare a scoring script and environment, both are auto generated. 

1. Go to the Automated ML page in the studio
1. Select your experiment and run
1. Choose the Models tab
1. Select the model you want to deploy 
1. Once you select a model, the Deploy button will light up with a drop-down menu
1. Select *Deploy to real-time endpoint* option

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-automl-endpoint/environment.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-automl-endpoint/environment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the generated Environment":::

5. Complete the wizard to deploy the model to an online endpoint

## Deploy manually from the studio or command line

If you wish to have more control over the deployment, you can download the training artifacts and deploy them. 

To download the components you'll need for deployment:

1. Go to your Automated ML experiment and run in your machine learning workspace
1. Choose the Models tab
1. Select the model you wish to use. Once you select a model, the *Download* button will become enabled
1. Choose *Download*

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-automl-endpoint/download-model.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-automl-endpoint/download-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of the model and download button":::

You'll receive a zip file containing:
* A conda environment specification file named `conda_env_<VERSION>.yml`
* A Python scoring file named `scoring_file_<VERSION>.py`
* The model itself, in a Python `.pkl` file named `model.pkl`

To deploy using these files, you can use either the studio or the Azure CLI.

# [Studio](#tab/Studio)

1. Go to the Models page in Azure Machine Learning studio

1. Select + Register Model option

1. Register the model you downloaded from Automated ML run

1. Go to Environments page, select Custom environment, and select + Create option to create an environment for your deployment. Use the downloaded conda yaml to create a custom environment

1. Select the model, and from the Deploy drop-down option, select Deploy to real-time endpoint

1. Complete all the steps in wizard to create an online endpoint and deployment

 
# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

## Configure the CLI 

To create a deployment from the CLI, you'll need the Azure CLI with the ML v2 extension. Run the following command to confirm that you've both:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/misc.sh" id="az_version":::

If you receive an error message or you don't see `Extensions: ml` in the response, follow the steps at [Install and set up the CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md).

Sign in:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/misc.sh" id="az_login":::

If you've access to multiple Azure subscriptions, you can set your active subscription:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/misc.sh" id="az_account_set":::

Set the default resource group and workspace to where you wish to create the deployment:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/setup.sh" id="az_configure_defaults":::

## Put the scoring file in its own directory

Create a directory called `src/` and place the scoring file you downloaded into it. This directory is uploaded to Azure and contains all the source code necessary to do inference. For an AutoML model, there's just the single scoring file. 

## Create the endpoint and deployment yaml file

To create an online endpoint from the command line, you'll need to create an *endpoint.yml* and a *deployment.yml* file. The following code, taken from the [Azure Machine Learning Examples repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) shows the _endpoints/online/managed/sample/_, which captures all the required inputs:

__automl_endpoint.yml__

::: code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/managed/sample/endpoint.yml" :::

__automl_deployment.yml__

::: code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/managed/sample/blue-deployment.yml" :::

You'll need to modify this file to use the files you downloaded from the AutoML Models page.

1. Create a file `automl_endpoint.yml` and `automl_deployment.yml` and paste the contents of the above example.

1. Change the value of the `name` of the endpoint. The endpoint name needs to be unique within the Azure region. The name for an endpoint must start with an upper- or lowercase letter and only consist of '-'s and alphanumeric characters.

1. In the `automl_deployment` file, change the value of the keys at the following paths:

    | Path | Change to |
    | --- | --- |
    | `model:path` | The path to the `model.pkl` file you downloaded. |
    | `code_configuration:code:path` | The directory in which you placed the scoring file. | 
    | `code_configuration:scoring_script` | The name of the Python scoring file (`scoring_file_<VERSION>.py`). |
    | `environment:conda_file` | A file URL for the downloaded conda environment file (`conda_env_<VERSION>.yml`). |

    > [!NOTE]
    > For a full description of the YAML, see [Online endpoint YAML reference](reference-yaml-endpoint-online.md).

1. From the command line, run: 

    [!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

    ```azurecli
    az ml online-endpoint create -f automl_endpoint.yml
    az ml online-deployment create -f automl_deployment.yml
    ```
    
After you create a deployment, you can score it as described in [Invoke the endpoint to score data by using your model](how-to-deploy-online-endpoints.md#invoke-the-endpoint-to-score-data-by-using-your-model).


# [Python SDK](#tab/python)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](../../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

## Configure the Python SDK

If you haven't installed Python SDK v2 yet, please install with this command:

```azurecli
pip install azure-ai-ml
```

For more information, see [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-ml-readme).

## Put the scoring file in its own directory

Create a directory called `src/` and place the scoring file you downloaded into it. This directory is uploaded to Azure and contains all the source code necessary to do inference. For an AutoML model, there's just the single scoring file. 

## Connect to Azure Machine Learning workspace

1. Import the required libraries:

    ```python
    # import required libraries
    from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import (
        ManagedOnlineEndpoint,
        ManagedOnlineDeployment,
        Model,
        Environment,
        CodeConfiguration,
    )
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    ```

1. Configure workspace details and get a handle to the workspace:

    ```python
    # enter details of your AzureML workspace
    subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
    resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
    workspace = "<AZUREML_WORKSPACE_NAME>"
    ```

    ```python
    # get a handle to the workspace
    ml_client = MLClient(
        DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace
    )
    ```

## Create the endpoint and deployment

Next, we'll create the managed online endpoints and deployments.

1. Configure online endpoint:

    > [!TIP]
    > * `name`: The name of the endpoint. It must be unique in the Azure region. The name for an endpoint must start with an upper- or lowercase letter and only consist of '-'s and alphanumeric characters. For more information on the naming rules, see [managed online endpoint limits](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints).
    > * `auth_mode` : Use `key` for key-based authentication. Use `aml_token` for Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication. A `key` doesn't expire, but `aml_token` does expire. For more information on authenticating, see [Authenticate to an online endpoint](how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md).


    ```python
    # Creating a unique endpoint name with current datetime to avoid conflicts
    import datetime

    online_endpoint_name = "endpoint-" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m%d%H%M%f")

    # create an online endpoint
    endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(
        name=online_endpoint_name,
        description="this is a sample online endpoint",
        auth_mode="key",
    )
    ```

1. Create the endpoint:

    Using the `MLClient` created earlier, we'll now create the Endpoint in the workspace. This command will start the endpoint creation and return a confirmation response while the endpoint creation continues.

    ```python
    ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint)
    ```

1. Configure online deployment:

    A deployment is a set of resources required for hosting the model that does the actual inferencing. We'll create a deployment for our endpoint using the `ManagedOnlineDeployment` class.

    ```python
    model = Model(path="./src/model.pkl")
    env = Environment(
        conda_file="./src/conda_env_v_1_0_0.yml",
        image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04:latest",
    )

    blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
        name="blue",
        endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
        model=model,
        environment=env,
        code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(
            code="./src", scoring_script="scoring_file_v_2_0_0.py"
        ),
        instance_type="Standard_DS2_v2",
        instance_count=1,
    )
    ```

    In the above example, we assume the files you downloaded from the AutoML Models page are in the `src` directory. You can modify the parameters in the code to suit your situation.
    
    | Parameter | Change to |
    | --- | --- |
    | `model:path` | The path to the `model.pkl` file you downloaded. |
    | `code_configuration:code:path` | The directory in which you placed the scoring file. | 
    | `code_configuration:scoring_script` | The name of the Python scoring file (`scoring_file_<VERSION>.py`). |
    | `environment:conda_file` | A file URL for the downloaded conda environment file (`conda_env_<VERSION>.yml`). |

1. Create the deployment:

    Using the `MLClient` created earlier, we'll now create the deployment in the workspace. This command will start the deployment creation and return a confirmation response while the deployment creation continues.

    ```python
    ml_client.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment)
    ```

After you create a deployment, you can score it as described in [Test the endpoint with sample data](how-to-deploy-managed-online-endpoint-sdk-v2.md#test-the-endpoint-with-sample-data).

You can learn to deploy to managed online endpoints with SDK more in [Deploy machine learning models to managed online endpoint using Python SDK v2](how-to-deploy-managed-online-endpoint-sdk-v2.md).
