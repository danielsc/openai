# Monitor and analyze jobs in studio


You can use [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) to monitor, organize, and track your jobs for training and experimentation. Your ML job history is an important part of an explainable and repeatable ML development process.

This article shows how to do the following tasks:

* Add job display name. 
* Create a custom view. 
* Add a job description. 
* Tag and find jobs.
* Run search over your job history.
* Cancel or fail jobs.
* Monitor the job status by email notification.
* Monitor your job resources (preview)
 

> [!TIP]
> * If you're looking for information on using the Azure Machine Learning SDK v1 or CLI v1, see [How to track, monitor, and analyze jobs (v1)](./v1/how-to-track-monitor-analyze-runs.md).
> * If you're looking for information on monitoring training jobs from the CLI or SDK v2, see [Track experiments with MLflow and CLI v2](how-to-use-mlflow-cli-runs.md).
> * If you're looking for information on monitoring the Azure Machine Learning service and associated Azure services, see [How to monitor Azure Machine Learning](monitor-azure-machine-learning.md).
>
> If you're looking for information on monitoring models deployed to online endpoints, see [Monitor online endpoints](how-to-monitor-online-endpoints.md).

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following items:

* To use Azure Machine Learning, you must have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* You must have an Azure Machine Learning workspace. A workspace is created in [Install, set up, and use the CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md).

## Job display name 

The job display name is an optional and customizable name that you can provide for your job. To edit the job display name:

1. Navigate to the **Jobs** list. 

1. Select the job to edit.

1. Select the **Edit** button to edit the job display name.

## Custom View 
    
To view your jobs in the studio: 
    
1. Navigate to the **Jobs** tab.
    
1. Select either **All experiments** to view all the jobs in an experiment or select **All jobs** to view all the jobs submitted in the Workspace.
    
In the **All jobs'** page, you can filter the jobs list by tags, experiments, compute target and more to better organize and scope your work.  
    
1. Make customizations to the page by selecting jobs to compare, adding charts or applying filters. These changes can be saved as a **Custom View** so you can easily return to your work. Users with workspace permissions can edit, or view the custom view. Also, share the custom view with team members for enhanced collaboration by selecting **Share view**.

1. To view the job logs, select a specific job and in the **Outputs + logs** tab, you can find diagnostic and error logs for your job.

## Job description 

A job description can be added to a job to provide more context and information to the job. You can also search on these descriptions from the jobs list and add the job description as a column in the jobs list. 

Navigate to the **Job Details** page for your job and select the edit or pencil icon to add, edit, or delete descriptions for your job. To persist the changes to the jobs list, save the changes to your existing Custom View or a new Custom View. Markdown format is supported for job descriptions, which allows images to be embedded and deep linking as shown below.

## Tag and find jobs

In Azure Machine Learning, you can use properties and tags to help organize and query your jobs for important information.

* Edit tags

    You can add, edit, or delete job tags from the studio. Navigate to the **Job Details** page for your job and select the edit, or pencil icon to add, edit, or delete tags for your jobs. You can also search and filter on these tags from the jobs list page.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-track-monitor-analyze-runs/run-tags.gif" alt-text="Screenshot of how to add, edit, or delete job tags.":::
    

* Query properties and tags

    You can query jobs within an experiment to return a list of jobs that match specific properties and tags.
    
    To search for specific jobs, navigate to the  **All jobs** list. From there you have two options:
    
    1. Use the **Add filter** button and select filter on tags to filter your jobs by tag that was assigned to the job(s). <br><br>
    OR
    
    1. Use the search bar to quickly find jobs by searching on the job metadata like the job status, descriptions, experiment names, and submitter name. 

## Cancel or fail jobs

If you notice a mistake or if your job is taking too long to finish, you can cancel the job.

To cancel a job in the studio, using the following steps:

1. Go to the running pipeline in either the **Jobs** or **Pipelines** section. 

1. Select the pipeline job number you want to cancel.

1. In the toolbar, select **Cancel**.

## Monitor the job status by email notification

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the left navigation bar, select the **Monitor** tab. 

1. Select **Diagnostic settings** and then select **+ Add diagnostic setting**.

    ![Screenshot of diagnostic settings for email notification](./media/how-to-track-monitor-analyze-runs/diagnostic-setting.png)

1. In the Diagnostic Setting, 
    1. under the **Category details**, select the **AmlRunStatusChangedEvent**. 
    1. In the **Destination details**, select the **Send to Log Analytics workspace**  and specify the **Subscription** and **Log Analytics workspace**. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Azure Log Analytics Workspace** is a different type of Azure Resource than the **Azure Machine Learning service Workspace**. If there are no options in that list, you can [create a Log Analytics Workspace](../azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace.md). 
    
    ![Where to save email notification](./media/how-to-track-monitor-analyze-runs/log-location.png)

1. In the **Logs** tab, add a **New alert rule**. 

    ![New alert rule](./media/how-to-track-monitor-analyze-runs/new-alert-rule.png)

1. See [how to create and manage log alerts using Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log.md).

## Monitor your job resources (preview)

Navigate to your job in the studio and select the Monitoring tab. This view provides insights on your job's resources on a 30 day rolling basis. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-track-monitor-analyze-runs/monitoring-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Monitoring tab showing resources the selected job has used.":::

>[!NOTE] 
>This view supports only compute that is managed by AzureML.
>Jobs with a runtime of less than 5 minutes will not have enough data to populate this view.
