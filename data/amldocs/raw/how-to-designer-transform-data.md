# Transform data in Azure Machine Learning designer

In this article, you'll learn how to transform and save datasets in the Azure Machine Learning designer, to prepare your own data for machine learning.

You'll use the sample [Adult Census Income Binary Classification](./samples-designer.md) dataset to prepare two datasets: one dataset that includes adult census information from only the United States, and another dataset that includes census information from non-US adults.

In this article, you'll learn how to:

1. Transform a dataset to prepare it for training.
1. Export the resulting datasets to a datastore.
1. View the results.

This how-to is a prerequisite for the [how to retrain designer models](how-to-retrain-designer.md) article. In that article, you'll learn how to use the transformed datasets to train multiple models, with pipeline parameters.

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-missing-ui](../../includes/machine-learning-missing-ui.md)]

## Transform a dataset

In this section, you'll learn how to import the sample dataset, and split the data into US and non-US datasets. See [how to import data](v1/how-to-designer-import-data.md) for more information about how to import your own data into the designer.

### Import data

Use these steps to import the sample dataset:

1. Sign in to <a href="https://ml.azure.com?tabs=jre" target="_blank">ml.azure.com</a>, and select the workspace you want to use.

1. Go to the designer. Select **Easy-to-use-prebuild components** to create a new pipeline.

1. Select a default compute target to run the pipeline.

1. To the left of the pipeline canvas, you'll see a palette of datasets and components. Select **Datasets**. Then view the **Samples** section.

1. Drag and drop the **Adult Census Income Binary classification** dataset onto the canvas.

1. Right-click the **Adult Census Income** dataset component, and select **Visualize** > **Dataset output**

1. Use the data preview window to explore the dataset. Take special note of the "native-country" column values.

### Split the data

In this section, you'll use the [Split Data component](algorithm-module-reference/split-data.md) to identify and split rows that contain "United-States" in the "native-country" column.

1. To the left of the canvas, in the component palette, expand the **Data Transformation** section, and find the **Split Data** component.

1. Drag the **Split Data** component onto the canvas, and drop that component below the dataset component.

1. Connect the dataset component to the **Split Data** component.

1. Select the **Split Data** component.

1. To the right of the canvas in the component details pane, set **Splitting mode** to **Regular Expression**.

1. Enter the **Regular Expression**: `\"native-country" United-States`.

    The **Regular expression** mode tests a single column for a value. See the related [algorithm component reference page](algorithm-module-reference/split-data.md) for more information on the Split Data component.

Your pipeline should look like this:

## Save the datasets

Now that you set up your pipeline to split the data, you must specify where to persist the datasets. For this example, use the **Export Data** component to save your dataset to a datastore. See [Connect to Azure storage services](how-to-access-data.md) for more information about datastores.

1. To the left of the canvas in the component palette, expand the **Data Input and Output** section, and find the **Export Data** component.

1. Drag and drop two **Export Data** components below the **Split Data** component.

1. Connect each output port of the **Split Data** component to a different **Export Data** component.

    Your pipeline should look something like this:

    ![Screenshot showing how to connect the Export Data components](media/how-to-designer-transform-data/export-data-pipeline.png).

1. Select the **Export Data** component connected to the *left*-most port of the **Split Data** component.

    For the **Split Data** component, the output port order matters. The first output port contains the rows where the regular expression is true. In this case, the first port contains rows for US-based income, and the second port contains rows for non-US based income.

1. In the component details pane to the right of the canvas, set the following options:
    
    **Datastore type**: Azure Blob Storage

    **Datastore**: Select an existing datastore, or select "New datastore" to create one now.

    **Path**: `/data/us-income`

    **File format**: csv

    > [!NOTE]
    > This article assumes that you have access to a datastore registered to the current Azure Machine Learning workspace. See [Connect to Azure storage services](v1/how-to-connect-data-ui.md#create-datastores) for datastore setup instructions.

    You can create a datastore if you don't have one now. For example purposes, this article will save the datasets to the default blob storage account associated with the workspace. It will save the datasets into the `azureml` container, in a new folder named `data`.

1.  Select the **Export Data** component connected to the *right*-most port of the **Split Data** component.

1. To the right of the canvas in the component details pane, set the following options:
    
    **Datastore type**: Azure Blob Storage

    **Datastore**: Select the same datastore as above

    **Path**: `/data/non-us-income`

    **File format**: csv

1. Verify that the **Export Data** component connected to the left port of the **Split Data** has the **Path** `/data/us-income`.

1. Verify that the **Export Data** component connected to the right port has the **Path** `/data/non-us-income`.

    Your pipeline and settings should look like this:
    
    ![Screenshot showing how to configure the Export Data components](media/how-to-designer-transform-data/us-income-export-data.png).

### Submit the job

Now that you set up your pipeline to split and export the data, submit a pipeline job.

1. Select **Submit** at the top of the canvas.

1. Select **Create new** in the **Set up pipeline job**, to create an experiment.

    Experiments logically group related pipeline jobs together. If you run this pipeline in the future, you should use the same experiment for logging and tracking purposes.

1. Provide a descriptive experiment name - for example "split-census-data".

1. Select **Submit**.

## View results

After the pipeline finishes running, you can navigate to your Azure portal blob storage to view your results. You can also view the intermediary results of the **Split Data** component to confirm that your data has been split correctly.

1. Select the **Split Data** component.

1. In the component details pane to the right of the canvas, select **Outputs + logs**.

1. Select the visualize icon ![visualize icon](media/how-to-designer-transform-data/visualize-icon.png) next to **Results dataset1**.

1. Verify that the "native-country" column contains only the value "United-States".

1. Select the visualize icon ![visualize icon](media/how-to-designer-transform-data/visualize-icon.png) next to **Results dataset2**.

1. Verify that the "native-country" column does not contain the value "United-States".
