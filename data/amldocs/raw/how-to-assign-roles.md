# Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace

In this article, you learn how to manage access (authorization) to an Azure Machine Learning workspace. [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md) is used to manage access to Azure resources, such as the ability to create new resources or use existing ones. Users in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are assigned specific roles, which grant access to resources. Azure provides both built-in roles and the ability to create custom roles.

> [!TIP]
> While this article focuses on Azure Machine Learning, individual services that Azure ML relies on provide their own RBAC settings. For example, using the information in this article, you can configure who can submit scoring requests to a model deployed as a web service on Azure Kubernetes Service. But Azure Kubernetes Service provides its own set of Azure roles. For service specific RBAC information that may be useful with Azure Machine Learning, see the following links:
>
> * [Control access to Azure Kubernetes cluster resources](../aks/azure-ad-rbac.md)
> * [Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization](../aks/manage-azure-rbac.md)
> * [Use Azure RBAC for access to blob data](../storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access.md)

> [!WARNING]
> Applying some roles may limit UI functionality in Azure Machine Learning studio for other users. For example, if a user's role does not have the ability to create a compute instance, the option to create a compute instance will not be available in studio. This behavior is expected, and prevents the user from attempting operations that would return an access denied error.

## Default roles

Azure Machine Learning workspaces have a five built-in roles that are available by default. When adding users to a workspace, they can be assigned one of the built-in roles described below.

| Role | Access level |
| --- | --- |
| **AzureML Data Scientist** | Can perform all actions within an Azure Machine Learning workspace, except for creating or deleting compute resources and modifying the workspace itself. |
| **AzureML Compute Operator** | Can create, manage and access compute resources within a workspace.|
| **Reader** | Read-only actions in the workspace. Readers can list and view assets, including [datastore](how-to-access-data.md) credentials, in a workspace. Readers can't create or update these assets. |
| **Contributor** | View, create, edit, or delete (where applicable) assets in a workspace. For example, contributors can create an experiment, create or attach a compute cluster, submit a run, and deploy a web service. |
| **Owner** | Full access to the workspace, including the ability to view, create, edit, or delete (where applicable) assets in a workspace. Additionally, you can change role assignments. |

In addition, [Azure Machine Learning registries](how-to-manage-registries.md) have a **AzureML Registry User** role that can be assigned to a registry resource to grant data scientists user-level prermissions. For administrator-level permissions to create or delete registries, use **Contributor** or **Owner** role.

| Role | Access level |
| --- | --- |
| **AzureML Registry User** | Can get registries, and read, write and delete assets within them. Cannot create new registry resources or delete them. |

You can combine the roles to grant different levels of access. For example, you can grant a workspace user both **AzureML Data Scientist** and **Azure ML Compute Operator** roles to permit the user to perform experiments while creating computes in a self-service manner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Role access can be scoped to multiple levels in Azure. For example, someone with owner access to a workspace may not have owner access to the resource group that contains the workspace. For more information, see [How Azure RBAC works](../role-based-access-control/overview.md#how-azure-rbac-works).


## Manage workspace access

If you're an owner of a workspace, you can add and remove roles for the workspace. You can also assign roles to users. Use the following links to discover how to manage access:
- [Azure portal UI](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md)
- [PowerShell](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell.md)
- [Azure CLI](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli.md)
- [REST API](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-rest.md)
- [Azure Resource Manager templates](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-template.md)

## Use Azure AD security groups to manage workspace access

You can use Azure AD security groups to manage access to workspaces. This approach has following benefits:
 * Team or project leaders can manage user access to workspace as security group owners, without needing Owner role on the workspace resource directly.
 * You can organize, manage and revoke users' permissions on workspace and other resources as a group, without having to manage permissions on user-by-user basis.
 * Using Azure AD groups helps you to avoid reaching the [subscription limit](../role-based-access-control/troubleshooting.md#limits) on role assignments. 

To use Azure AD security groups:
 1. [Create a security group](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-view-azure-portal.md).
 2. [Add a group owner](../active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups.md#add-or-remove-members-and-owners). This user has permissions to add or remove group members. Note that the group owner isn't required to be group member, or have direct RBAC role on the workspace.
 3. Assign the group an RBAC role on the workspace, such as AzureML Data Scientist, Reader or Contributor. 
 4. [Add group members](../active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups.md#add-or-remove-members-and-owners). The members consequently gain access to the workspace.

## Create custom role

If the built-in roles are insufficient, you can create custom roles. Custom roles might have read, write, delete, and compute resource permissions in that workspace. You can make the role available at a specific workspace level, a specific resource group level, or a specific subscription level.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be an owner of the resource at that level to create custom roles within that resource.

To create a custom role, first construct a role definition JSON file that specifies the permission and scope for the role. The following example defines a custom role named "Data Scientist Custom" scoped at a specific workspace level:

`data_scientist_custom_role.json` :
```json
{
    "Name": "Data Scientist Custom",
    "IsCustom": true,
    "Description": "Can run experiment but can't create or delete compute.",
    "Actions": ["*"],
    "NotActions": [
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/delete",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/delete", 
        "Microsoft.Authorization/*/write"
    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace_name>"
    ]
}
```

> [!TIP]
> You can change the `AssignableScopes` field to set the scope of this custom role at the subscription level, the resource group level, or a specific workspace level.
> The above custom role is just an example, see some suggested [custom roles for the Azure Machine Learning service](#customroles).

This custom role can do everything in the workspace except for the following actions:

- It can't delete the workspace.
- It can't create or update the workspace.
- It can't create or update compute resources.
- It can't delete compute resources.
- It can't add, delete, or alter role assignments.

To deploy this custom role, use the following Azure CLI command:

```azurecli-interactive 
az role definition create --role-definition data_scientist_role.json
```

After deployment, this role becomes available in the specified workspace. Now you can add and assign this role in the Azure portal.

For more information on custom roles, see [Azure custom roles](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md). 

### Azure Machine Learning operations

For more information on the operations (actions and not actions) usable with custom roles, see [Resource provider operations](../role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations.md#microsoftmachinelearningservices). You can also use the following Azure CLI command to list operations:

```azurecli-interactive
az provider operation show â€“n Microsoft.MachineLearningServices
```

## List custom roles

In the Azure CLI, run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az role definition list --subscription <sub-id> --custom-role-only true
```

To view the role definition for a specific custom role, use the following Azure CLI command. The `<role-name>` should be in the same format returned by the command above:

```azurecli-interactive
az role definition list -n <role-name> --subscription <sub-id>
```

## Update a custom role

In the Azure CLI, run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az role definition update --role-definition update_def.json --subscription <sub-id>
```

You need to have permissions on the entire scope of your new role definition. For example if this new role has a scope across three subscriptions, you need to have permissions on all three subscriptions. 

> [!NOTE]
> Role updates can take 15 minutes to an hour to apply across all role assignments in that scope.

## Use Azure Resource Manager templates for repeatability

If you anticipate that you'll need to recreate complex role assignments, an Azure Resource Manager template can be a significant help. The [machine-learning-dependencies-role-assignment template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master//quickstarts/microsoft.machinelearningservices/machine-learning-dependencies-role-assignment) shows how role assignments can be specified in source code for reuse. 

## Common scenarios

The following table is a summary of Azure Machine Learning activities and the permissions required to perform them at the least scope. For example, if an activity can be performed with a workspace scope (Column 4), then all higher scope with that permission will also work automatically. Note that for certain activities the permissions differ between V1 and V2 APIs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All paths in this table that start with `/` are **relative paths** to `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/` :

| Activity | Subscription-level scope | Resource group-level scope | Workspace-level scope |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Create new workspace <sub>1</sub> | Not required | Owner or contributor | N/A (becomes Owner or inherits higher scope role after creation) |
| Request subscription level Amlcompute quota or set workspace level quota | Owner, or contributor, or custom role </br>allowing `/locations/updateQuotas/action`</br> at subscription scope | Not Authorized | Not Authorized |
| Create new compute cluster | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `/workspaces/computes/write` |
| Create new compute instance | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `/workspaces/computes/write` |
| Submitting any type of run (V1) | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `"/workspaces/*/read", "/workspaces/environments/write", "/workspaces/experiments/runs/write", "/workspaces/metadata/artifacts/write", "/workspaces/metadata/snapshots/write", "/workspaces/environments/build/action", "/workspaces/experiments/runs/submit/action", "/workspaces/environments/readSecrets/action"` |
| Submitting any type of run (V2) | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `"/workspaces/*/read", "/workspaces/environments/write", "/workspaces/jobs/*", "/workspaces/metadata/artifacts/write", "/workspaces/metadata/codes/*/write", "/workspaces/environments/build/action", "/workspaces/environments/readSecrets/action"` |
| Publishing pipelines and endpoints (V1) | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `"/workspaces/endpoints/pipelines/*", "/workspaces/pipelinedrafts/*", "/workspaces/modules/*"` |
| Publishing pipelines and endpoints (V2) | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `"/workspaces/endpoints/pipelines/*", "/workspaces/pipelinedrafts/*", "/workspaces/components/*"` |
| Attach an AKS resource <sub>2</sub> | Not required | Owner or contributor on the resource group that contains AKS | 
| Deploying a registered model on an AKS/ACI resource | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `"/workspaces/services/aks/write", "/workspaces/services/aci/write"` |
| Scoring against a deployed AKS endpoint | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `"/workspaces/services/aks/score/action", "/workspaces/services/aks/listkeys/action"` (when you are not using Azure Active Directory auth) OR `"/workspaces/read"` (when you are using token auth) |
| Accessing storage using interactive notebooks | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `"/workspaces/computes/read", "/workspaces/notebooks/samples/read", "/workspaces/notebooks/storage/*", "/workspaces/listStorageAccountKeys/action", "/workspaces/listNotebookAccessToken/read"`|
| Create new custom role | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write` | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing: `/workspaces/computes/write` |
| Create/manage online endpoints and deployments | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/*` |
| Retrieve authentication credentials for online endpoints | Not required | Not required | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/token/action` and `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/listkeys/action`.

1: If you receive a failure when trying to create a workspace for the first time, make sure that your role allows `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/register/action`. This action allows you to register the Azure Machine Learning resource provider with your Azure subscription.

2: When attaching an AKS cluster, you also need to have the [Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-admin-role) on the cluster.

### Differences between actions for V1 and V2 APIs

There are certain differences between actions for V1 APIs and V2 APIs.

| Asset | Action path for V1 API | Action path for V2 API
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Dataset | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/datasets | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/datasets/versions |
| Experiment runs and jobs | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/experiments | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/jobs |
| Models | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models/versions |
| Snapshots and code | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/snapshots | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/codes/versions |
| Modules and components | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/modules | Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/components |

You can make custom roles compatible with both V1 and V2 APIs by including both actions, or using wildcards that include both actions, for example Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/datasets/*/read.

### Create a workspace using a customer-managed key

When using a customer-managed key (CMK), an Azure Key Vault is used to store the key. The user or service principal used to create the workspace must have owner or contributor access to the key vault.

Within the key vault, the user or service principal must have create, get, delete, and purge access to the key through a key vault access policy. For more information, see [Azure Key Vault security](../key-vault/general/security-features.md#controlling-access-to-key-vault-data).

### User-assigned managed identity with Azure ML compute cluster

ToÂ assign a user assigned identity to an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster, you need write permissions to create the compute and the [Managed Identity OperatorÂ Role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-operator). For more information on Azure RBAC with Managed Identities, read [How to manage user assigned identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal.md)

### MLflow operations

To perform MLflow operations with your Azure Machine Learning workspace, use the following scopes your custom role:

| MLflow operation | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| (V1) List, read, create, update or delete experiments | `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/experiments/*` |
| (V2) List, read, create, update or delete jobs | `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/jobs/*` |
| Get registered model by name, fetch a list of all registered models in the registry, search for registered models, latest version models for each requests stage, get a registered model's version, search model versions, get URI where a model version's artifacts are stored, search for runs by experiment ids | `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models/*/read` |
| Create a new registered model, update a registered model's name/description, rename existing registered model, create new version of the model, update a model version's description, transition a registered model to one of the stages | `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models/*/write` |
| Delete a registered model along with all its version, delete specific versions of a registered model | `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models/*/delete` |

        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/delete",
        "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/*"
    ],
    "NotActions": [
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/write"
    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>"
    ]
}
```

### Data labeling

    "Description": "Can label data for Labeling",
    "Actions": [
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/read",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/labeling/projects/read",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/labeling/projects/summary/read",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/labeling/labels/read",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/labeling/labels/write"   
    ],
    "NotActions": [        
    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>"

    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>"
    ]
}
```

# [Customer QA](#tab/customer-qa)

A customer quality assurance role can view project dashboards, preview datasets, export a labeling project, and review submitted labels. This role can't submit labels.

`customer_qa_role.json` :
```json
{
    "Name": "Customer QA",
    "IsCustom": true,
    "Description": "Customer QA for Labeling Projects",
    "Actions": [

## Troubleshooting

Here are a few things to be aware of while you use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC):

- When you create a resource in Azure, such as a workspace, you're not directly the owner of the resource. Your role is inherited from the highest scope role that you're authorized against in that subscription. As an example if you're a Network Administrator, and have the permissions to create a Machine Learning workspace, you would be assigned the Network Administrator role against that workspace, and not the Owner role.

- To perform quota operations in a workspace, you need subscription level permissions. This means setting either subscription level quota or workspace level quota for your managed compute resources can only happen if you have write permissions at the subscription scope.

- When there are two role assignments to the same Azure Active Directory user with conflicting sections of Actions/NotActions, your operations listed in NotActions from one role might not take effect if they are also listed as Actions in another role. To learn more about how Azure parses role assignments, read [How Azure RBAC determines if a user has access to a resource](../role-based-access-control/overview.md#how-azure-rbac-determines-if-a-user-has-access-to-a-resource)

- To deploy your compute resources inside a VNet, you need to explicitly have permissions for the following actions:
    - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/*/read` on the VNet resources.
    - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action` on the subnet resource.
    
    For more information on Azure RBAC with networking, see the [Networking built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#networking).

- It can sometimes take up to 1 hour for your new role assignments to take effect over cached permissions across the stack.
