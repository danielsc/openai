# Create and run machine learning pipelines using components with the Azure Machine Learning CLI

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]


In this article, you learn how to create and run [machine learning pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md) by using the Azure CLI and components (for more, see [What is an Azure Machine Learning component?](concept-component.md)). You can create pipelines without using components, but components offer the greatest amount of flexibility and reuse. AzureML Pipelines may be defined in YAML and run from the CLI, authored in Python, or composed in AzureML Studio Designer with a drag-and-drop UI. This document focuses on the CLI.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace. [Create workspace resources](quickstart-create-resources.md).

- [Install and set up the Azure CLI extension for Machine Learning](how-to-configure-cli.md).

- Clone the examples repository:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --depth 1
    cd azureml-examples/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics
    ```

- [What is Azure Machine Learning component](./concept-component.md)

## Create your first pipeline with component

Let's create your first pipeline with component using an example. This section aims to give you an initial impression of what pipeline and component look like in AzureML with a concrete example.

From the `cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics` directory of the [`azureml-examples` repository](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples), navigate to the `3b_pipeline_with_data` subdirector. There are three types of files in this directory. Those are the files you'll need to create when building your own pipeline.

- **pipeline.yml**: This YAML file defines the machine learning pipeline. This YAML file describes how to break a full machine learning task into a multistep workflow. For example, considering a simple machine learning task of using historical data to train a sales forecasting model, you may want to build a sequential workflow with data processing, model training, and model evaluation steps.  Each step is a component that has well defined interface and can be developed, tested, and optimized independently. The pipeline YAML also defines how the child steps connect to other steps in the pipeline, for example the model training step generate a model file and the model file will pass to a model evaluation step.

- **component.yml**:  This YAML file defines the component. It packages following information:
  - Metadata: name, display name, version, description, type etc. The metadata helps to describe and manage the component.
  - Interface: inputs and outputs. For example, a model training component will take training data and number of epochs as input, and generate a trained model file as output. Once the interface is defined, different teams can develop and test the component independently.
  - Command, code & environment: the command, code and environment to run the component.    Command is the shell command to execute the component. Code usually refers to a source  code directory. Environment could be an AzureML environment(curated or customer created), docker image or conda environment.  

- **component_src**: This is the source code directory for a specific component. It contains the source code that will be executed in the component. You can use your preferred language(Python, R...). The code must be executed by a shell command. The source code can take a few inputs from shell command line to control how this step is going to be executed. For example, a training step may take training data, learning rate, number of epochs to control the training process. The argument of a shell command is used to pass inputs and outputs to the code. 

 Now let's create a pipeline using the `3b_pipeline_with_data` example. We'll explain the detailed meaning of each file in following sections. 
 
 First list your available compute resources with the following command: 

```azurecli
az ml compute list
```

If you don't have it, create a cluster called `cpu-cluster` by running:

```azurecli
az ml compute create -n cpu-cluster --type amlcompute --min-instances 0 --max-instances 10
```

Now, create a pipeline job defined in the pipeline.yml file with the following command. The compute target will be referenced in the pipeline.yml file as `azureml:cpu-cluster`. If your compute target uses a different name, remember to update it in the pipeline.yml file. 

```azurecli
az ml job create --file pipeline.yml
```

You should receive a JSON dictionary with information about the pipeline job, including:

| Key                        | Description                                                           |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                     | The GUID-based name of the job.                                       |
| `experiment_name`          | The name under which jobs will be organized in Studio.                |
| `services.Studio.endpoint` | A URL for monitoring and reviewing the pipeline job.                  |
| `status`                   | The status of the job. This will likely be `Preparing` at this point. |

Open the `services.Studio.endpoint` URL you'll see a graph visualization of the pipeline looks like below.

## Understand the pipeline definition YAML

Let's take a look at the pipeline definition in the *3b_pipeline_with_data/pipeline.yml* file.  

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/3b_pipeline_with_data/pipeline.yml":::

Below table describes the most common used fields of pipeline YAML schema. See [full pipeline YAML schema here](reference-yaml-job-pipeline.md).  

|key|description|
|------|------|
|type|**Required**. Job type, must be `pipeline` for pipeline jobs.|
|display_name|Display name of the pipeline job in Studio UI. Editable in Studio UI. Doesn't have to be unique across all jobs in the workspace.|
|jobs|**Required**. Dictionary of the set of individual jobs to run as steps within the pipeline. These jobs are considered child jobs of the parent pipeline job. In this release, supported job types in pipeline are `command` and `sweep`
|inputs|Dictionary of inputs to the pipeline job. The key is a name for the input within the context of the job and the value is the input value. These pipeline inputs can be referenced by the inputs of an individual step job in the pipeline using the ${{ parent.inputs.<input_name> }} expression.|
|outputs|Dictionary of output configurations of the pipeline job. The key is a name for the output within the context of the job and the value is the output configuration. These pipeline outputs can be referenced by the outputs of an individual step job in the pipeline using the ${{ parents.outputs.<output_name> }} expression. |

In the *3b_pipeline_with_data* example, we've created a three steps pipeline.

- The three steps are defined under `jobs`. All three step type is command job. Each step's definition is in corresponding `component.yml` file. You can see the component YAML files under *3b_pipeline_with_data* directory. We'll explain the componentA.yml in next section.
- This pipeline has data dependency, which is common in most real world pipelines. Component_a takes data input from local folder under `./data`(line 17-20) and passes its output to componentB (line 29). Component_a's output can be referenced as `${{parent.jobs.component_a.outputs.component_a_output}}`.
- The `compute` defines the default compute for this pipeline. If a component under `jobs` defines a different compute for this component, the system will respect component specific setting.

### Read and write data in pipeline

One common scenario is to read and write data in your pipeline. In AzureML, we use the same schema to [read and write data](how-to-read-write-data-v2.md) for all type of jobs (pipeline job, command job, and sweep job). Below are pipeline job examples of using data for common scenarios.

- [local data](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/4a_local_data_input)
- [web file with public URL](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/4c_web_url_input/pipeline.yml)
- [AzureML datastore and path](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/4b_datastore_datapath_uri)
- [AzureML data asset](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/4d_data_input)

## Understand the component definition YAML

Now let's look at the *componentA.yml* as an example to understand component definition YAML.

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/3b_pipeline_with_data/componentA.yml":::

The most common used schema of the component YAML is described in below table. See [full component YAML schema here](reference-yaml-component-command.md).

|key|description|
|------|------|
|name|**Required**. Name of the component. Must be unique across the AzureML workspace. Must start with lowercase letter. Allow lowercase letters, numbers and underscore(_). Maximum length is 255 characters.|
|display_name|Display name of the component in the studio UI. Can be non-unique within the workspace.|
|command|**Required** the command to execute|
|code|Local path to the source code directory to be uploaded and used for the component.|
|environment|**Required**. The environment that will be used to execute the component.|
|inputs|Dictionary of component inputs. The key is a name for the input within the context of the component and the value is the component input definition. Inputs can be referenced in the command using the ${{ inputs.<input_name> }} expression.|
|outputs|Dictionary of component outputs. The key is a name for the output within the context of the component and the value is the component output definition. Outputs can be referenced in the command using the ${{ outputs.<output_name> }} expression.|
|is_deterministic|Whether to reuse the previous job's result if the component inputs did not change. Default value is `true`, also known as reuse by default. The common scenario when set as `false` is to force reload data from a cloud storage or URL.|

For the example in *3b_pipeline_with_data/componentA.yml*, componentA has one data input and one data output, which can be connected to other steps in the parent pipeline. All the files under `code` section in component YAML will be uploaded to AzureML when submitting the pipeline job. In this example, files under `./componentA_src` will be uploaded (line 16 in *componentA.yml*). You can see the uploaded source code in Studio UI: double select the ComponentA step and navigate to Snapshot tab, as shown in below screenshot. We can see it's a hello-world script just doing some simple printing, and write current datetime to the `componentA_output` path. The component takes input and output through command line argument, and it's handled in the *hello.py* using `argparse`.
  
:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/component-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pipeline with data example above showing componentA." lightbox="./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/component-snapshot.png":::

### Input and output
Input and output define the interface of a component. Input and output could be either of a literal value(of type `string`,`number`,`integer`, or `boolean`) or an object containing input schema.

**Object input** (of type `uri_file`, `uri_folder`,`mltable`,`mlflow_model`,`custom_model`) can connect to other steps in the parent pipeline job and hence pass data/model to other steps. In pipeline graph, the object type input will render as a connection dot.

**Literal value inputs** (`string`,`number`,`integer`,`boolean`) are the parameters you can pass to the component at run time. You can add default value of literal inputs under `default` field. For `number` and `integer` type, you can also add minimum and maximum value of the accepted value using `min` and `max` fields. If the input value exceeds the min and max, pipeline will fail at validation. Validation happens before you submit a pipeline job to save your time. Validation works for CLI, Python SDK and designer UI. Below screenshot shows a validation example in designer UI. Similarly, you can define allowed values in `enum` field.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/component-input-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the input and output of the train linear regression model component." lightbox= "./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/component-input-output.png":::

If you want to add an input to a component, remember to edit three places:  1)`inputs` field in component YAML 2) `command` field in component YAML. 3) component source code to handle the command line input. It's marked in green box in above screenshot.  

### Environment

Environment defines the environment to execute the component. It could be an AzureML environment(curated or custom registered), docker image or conda environment. See examples below.

- [AzureML registered environment asset](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/5b_env_registered). It's referenced in component following `azureml:<environment-name>:<environment-version>` syntax.
- [public docker image](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/5a_env_public_docker_image)
- [conda file](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/5c_env_conda_file) Conda file needs to be used together with a base image.

## Register component for reuse and sharing

While some components will be specific to a particular pipeline, the real benefit of components comes from reuse and sharing. Register a component in your Machine Learning workspace to make it available for reuse. Registered components support automatic versioning so you can update the component but assure that pipelines that require an older version will continue to work.  

In the azureml-examples repository, navigate to the `cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/1b_e2e_registered_components` directory. 

To register a component, use the `az ml component create` command:

```azurecli
az ml component create --file train.yml
az ml component create --file score.yml
az ml component create --file eval.yml
```

After these commands run to completion, you can see the components in Studio, under Asset -> Components:

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/registered-components.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Studio showing the components that were just registered." lightbox ="./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/registered-components.png":::

Select a component. You'll see detailed information for each version of the component.

Under **Details** tab, you'll see basic information of the component like name, created by, version etc. You'll see editable fields for Tags and Description. The tags can be used for adding rapidly searched keywords. The description field supports Markdown formatting and should be used to describe your component's functionality and basic use.

Under **Jobs** tab, you'll see the history of all jobs that use this component.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/registered-components.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the component tab showing 3 components." lightbox ="./media/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli/registered-components.png":::

### Use registered components in a pipeline job YAML file

Let's use `1b_e2e_registered_components` to demo how to use registered component in pipeline YAML. Navigate to `1b_e2e_registered_components` directory, open the `pipeline.yml` file. The keys and values in the `inputs` and `outputs` fields are similar to those already discussed. The only significant difference is the value of the `component` field in the `jobs.<JOB_NAME>.component` entries. The `component` value is of the form `azureml:<COMPONENT_NAME>:<COMPONENT_VERSION>`. The `train-job` definition, for instance, specifies the latest version of the registered component `my_train` should be used:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/1b_e2e_registered_components/pipeline.yml" range="24-36" highlight="4":::

### Manage components

You can check component details and manage the component using CLI (v2). Use `az ml component -h` to get detailed instructions on component command. Below table lists all available commands. See more examples in [Azure CLI reference](/cli/azure/ml/component?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true)

|commands|description|
|------|------|
|`az ml component create`|Create a component|
|`az ml component list`|List components in a workspace|
|`az ml component show`|Show details of a component|
|`az ml component update`|Update a component. Only a few fields(description, display_name) support update|
|`az ml component archive`|Archive a component container|
|`az ml component restore`|Restore an archived component|
