# Monitoring Azure machine learning data reference

Learn about the data and resources collected by Azure Monitor from your Azure Machine Learning workspace. See [Monitoring Azure Machine Learning](monitor-azure-machine-learning.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data.

## Metrics

This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics collected for Azure Machine Learning. The resource provider for these metrics is [Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftmachinelearningservicesworkspaces).
