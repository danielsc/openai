# CLI (v2) managed online deployment YAML schema

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

The source JSON schema can be found at https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineDeployment.schema.json.

[!INCLUDE [schema note](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-old-json-schema-note.md)]

## YAML syntax

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `$schema` | string | The YAML schema. If you use the Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension to author the YAML file, including `$schema` at the top of your file enables you to invoke schema and resource completions. | | |
| `name` | string | **Required.** Name of the deployment. <br><br> Naming rules are defined [here](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints).| | |
| `description` | string | Description of the deployment. | | |
| `tags` | object | Dictionary of tags for the deployment. | | |
| `endpoint_name` | string | **Required.** Name of the endpoint to create the deployment under. | | |
| `model` | string or object | The model to use for the deployment. This value can be either a reference to an existing versioned model in the workspace or an inline model specification. <br><br> To reference an existing model, use the `azureml:<model-name>:<model-version>` syntax. <br><br> To define a model inline, follow the [Model schema](reference-yaml-model.md#yaml-syntax). <br><br> As a best practice for production scenarios, you should create the model separately and reference it here. <br><br> This field is optional for [custom container deployment](how-to-deploy-custom-container.md) scenarios.| | |
| `model_mount_path` | string | The path to mount the model in a custom container. Applicable only for [custom container deployment](how-to-deploy-custom-container.md) scenarios. If the `model` field is specified, it's mounted on this path in the container. | | |
| `code_configuration` | object | Configuration for the scoring code logic. <br><br> This field is optional for [custom container deployment](how-to-deploy-custom-container.md) scenarios. | | |
| `code_configuration.code` | string | Local path to the source code directory for scoring the model. | | |
| `code_configuration.scoring_script` | string | Relative path to the scoring file in the source code directory. | | |
| `environment_variables` | object | Dictionary of environment variable key-value pairs to set in the deployment container. You can access these environment variables from your scoring scripts. | | |
| `environment` | string or object | **Required.** The environment to use for the deployment. This value can be either a reference to an existing versioned environment in the workspace or an inline environment specification. <br><br> To reference an existing environment, use the `azureml:<environment-name>:<environment-version>` syntax. <br><br> To define an environment inline, follow the [Environment schema](reference-yaml-environment.md#yaml-syntax). <br><br> As a best practice for production scenarios, you should create the environment separately and reference it here. | | |
| `instance_type` | string | **Required.** The VM size to use for the deployment. For the list of supported sizes, see [Managed online endpoints SKU list](reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list.md). | | |
| `instance_count` | integer | **Required.** The number of instances to use for the deployment. Specify the value based on the workload you expect. For high availability, Microsoft recommends you set it to at least `3`. <br><br> `instance_count` can be updated after deployment creation using `az ml online-deployment update` command. <br><br> We reserve an extra 20% for performing upgrades. For more information, see [managed online endpoint quotas](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints). | | |
| `app_insights_enabled` | boolean | Whether to enable integration with the Azure Application Insights instance associated with your workspace. | | `false` |
| `scale_settings` | object | The scale settings for the deployment. Currently only the `default` scale type is supported, so you don't need to specify this property. <br><br> With this `default` scale type, you can either manually scale the instance count up and down after deployment creation by updating the `instance_count` property, or create an [autoscaling policy](how-to-autoscale-endpoints.md). | | |
| `scale_settings.type` | string | The scale type. | `default` | `default` |
| `request_settings` | object | Scoring request settings for the deployment. See [RequestSettings](#requestsettings) for the set of configurable properties. | | |
| `liveness_probe` | object | Liveness probe settings for monitoring the health of the container regularly. See [ProbeSettings](#probesettings) for the set of configurable properties. | | |
| `readiness_probe` | object | Readiness probe settings for validating if the container is ready to serve traffic. See [ProbeSettings](#probesettings) for the set of configurable properties. | | |
| `egress_public_network_access` | string | This flag secures the deployment by restricting communication between the deployment and the Azure resources used by it. Set to `disabled` to ensure that the download of the model, code, and images needed by your deployment are secured with a private endpoint. This flag is applicable only for managed online endpoints. | `enabled`, `disabled` | `enabled` |

### RequestSettings

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `request_timeout_ms` | integer | The scoring timeout in milliseconds. | `5000` |
| `max_concurrent_requests_per_instance` | integer | The maximum number of concurrent requests per instance allowed for the deployment. <br><br> Set to the number of requests that your model can process concurrently on a single node. Setting this value higher than your model's actual concurrency can lead to higher latencies. Setting this value too low may lead to under utilized nodes. Setting too low may also result in requests being rejected with a 429 HTTP status code, as the system will opt to fail fast. <br><br> For more information, see [Troubleshooting online endpoints: HTTP status codes](how-to-troubleshoot-online-endpoints.md#http-status-codes). | `1` |
| `max_queue_wait_ms` | integer | The maximum amount of time in milliseconds a request will stay in the queue. | `500` |

### ProbeSettings

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `initial_delay` | integer | The number of seconds after the container has started before the probe is initiated. Minimum value is `1`. | `10` |
| `period` | integer | How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. | `10` |
| `timeout` | integer | The number of seconds after which the probe times out. Minimum value is `1`. | `2` |
| `success_threshold` | integer | The minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Minimum value is `1` for readiness probe. The value for liveness probe is fixed as `1`. | `1` |
| `failure_threshold` | integer | When a probe fails, the system will try `failure_threshold` times before giving up. Giving up in the case of a liveness probe means the container will be restarted. In the case of a readiness probe the container will be marked Unready. Minimum value is `1`. | `30` |

## Remarks

The `az ml online-deployment` commands can be used for managing Azure Machine Learning managed online deployments.
