# Debugging scoring script with Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server (preview)

The Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server [(preview)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) is a Python package that exposes your scoring function as an HTTP endpoint and wraps the Flask server code and dependencies into a singular package. It's included in the [prebuilt Docker images for inference](concept-prebuilt-docker-images-inference.md) that are used when deploying a model with Azure Machine Learning. Using the package alone, you can deploy the model locally for production, and you can also easily validate your scoring (entry) script in a local development environment. If there's a problem with the scoring script, the server will return an error and the location where the error occurred.

The server can also be used to create validation gates in a continuous integration and deployment pipeline. For example, you can start the server with the candidate script and run the test suite against the local endpoint.

This article mainly targets users who want to use the inference server to debug locally, but it will also help you understand how to use the inference server with online endpoints.

## Online endpoint local debugging

Debugging endpoints locally before deploying them to the cloud can help you catch errors in your code and configuration earlier. To debug endpoints locally, you could use:

- the Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server
- a [local endpoint](how-to-debug-managed-online-endpoints-visual-studio-code.md)

This article focuses on the Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server.

The following table provides an overview of scenarios to help you choose what works best for you.

| Scenario                                                                | Inference HTTP Server | Local endpoint |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Update local Python environment **without** Docker image rebuild        | Yes                   | No             |
| Update scoring script                                                   | Yes                   | Yes            |
| Update deployment configurations (deployment, environment, code, model) | No                    | Yes            |
| Integrate VS Code Debugger                                              | Yes                   | Yes            |

By running the inference HTTP server locally, you can focus on debugging your scoring script without being affected by the deployment container configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Requires: Python >=3.7
- Anaconda

> [!TIP]
> The Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server runs on Windows and Linux based operating systems.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid package conflicts, install the server in a virtual environment.

To install the `azureml-inference-server-http package`, run the following command in your cmd/terminal:

```bash
python -m pip install azureml-inference-server-http
```

## Debug your scoring script locally

To debug your scoring script locally, you can test how the server behaves with a dummy scoring script, use VS Code to debug with the [azureml-inference-server-http](https://pypi.org/project/azureml-inference-server-http/) package, or test the server with an actual scoring script, model file, and environment file from our [examples repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples).

### Test the server behavior with a dummy scoring script
1. Create a directory to hold your files:

    ```bash
    mkdir server_quickstart
    cd server_quickstart
    ```

1. To avoid package conflicts, create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > After testing, run `deactivate` to deactivate the Python virtual environment.

1. Install the `azureml-inference-server-http` package from the [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/azureml-inference-server-http/) feed:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install azureml-inference-server-http
    ```

1. Create your entry script (`score.py`). The following example creates a basic entry script:

    ```bash
    echo '
    import time

    def init():
        time.sleep(1)

    def run(input_data):
        return {"message":"Hello, World!"}
    ' > score.py
    ```

1. Start the server (azmlinfsrv) and set `score.py` as the entry script:

    ```bash
    azmlinfsrv --entry_script score.py
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The server is hosted on 0.0.0.0, which means it will listen to all IP addresses of the hosting machine.

1. Send a scoring request to the server using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -p 127.0.0.1:5001/score
    ```

    The server should respond like this.

    ```bash
    {"message": "Hello, World!"}
    ```

After testing, you can press `Ctrl + C` to terminate the server. 
Now you can modify the scoring script (`score.py`) and test your changes by running the server again (`azmlinfsrv --entry_script score.py`).

### How to integrate with Visual Studio Code

There are two ways to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) to debug with [azureml-inference-server-http](https://pypi.org/project/azureml-inference-server-http/) package ([Launch and Attach modes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-versus-attach-configurations)). 

-  **Launch mode**: set up the `launch.json` in VS Code and start the AzureML Inference HTTP Server within VS Code.
   1. Start VS Code and open the folder containing the script (`score.py`).
   1. Add the following configuration to `launch.json` for that workspace in VS Code:

        **launch.json**
        ```json
        {
            "version": "0.2.0",
            "configurations": [
                {
                    "name": "Debug score.py",
                    "type": "python",
                    "request": "launch",
                    "module": "azureml_inference_server_http.amlserver",
                    "args": [
                        "--entry_script",
                        "score.py"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    1. Start debugging session in VS Code. Select "Run" -> "Start Debugging" (or `F5`).

-  **Attach mode**: start the AzureML Inference HTTP Server in a command line and use VS Code + Python Extension to attach to the process.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're using Linux environment, first install the `gdb` package by running `sudo apt-get install -y gdb`.
   1. Add the following configuration to `launch.json` for that workspace in VS Code:
        
        **launch.json**
        ```json
        {
            "version": "0.2.0",
            "configurations": [
                {
                    "name": "Python: Attach using Process Id",
                    "type": "python",
                    "request": "attach",
                    "processId": "${command:pickProcess}",
                    "justMyCode": true
                },
            ]
        }
        ```
   1. Start the inference server using CLI (`azmlinfsrv --entry_script score.py`).
   1. Start debugging session in VS Code.
      1. In VS Code, select "Run" -> "Start Debugging" (or `F5`).
      1. Enter the process ID of the `azmlinfsrv` (not the `gunicorn`) using the logs (from the inference server) displayed in the CLI.
        :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-inference-server-http/debug-attach-pid.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the CLI which shows the process ID of the server.":::
        > [!NOTE]
        > If the process picker does not display, manually enter the process ID in the `processId` field of the `launch.json`.

In both ways, you can set [breakpoint](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints) and debug step by step.

### End-to-end example
In this section, we'll run the server locally with [sample files](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/endpoints/online/model-1) (scoring script, model file, and environment) in our example repository. The sample files are also used in our article for [Deploy and score a machine learning model by using an online endpoint](how-to-deploy-online-endpoints.md)

1. Clone the sample repository.

    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples
    cd azureml-examples/cli/endpoints/online/model-1/
    ```

1. Create and activate a virtual environment with [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).
    In this example, the `azureml-inference-server-http` package is automatically installed because it's included as a dependent library of the `azureml-defaults` package in `conda.yml` as follows.

    ```bash
    # Create the environment from the YAML file
    conda env create --name model-env -f ./environment/conda.yml
    # Activate the new environment
    conda activate model-env
    ```

1. Review your scoring script.

    __onlinescoring/score.py__  
    :::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/model-1/onlinescoring/score.py" :::

1. Run the inference server with specifying scoring script and model file.
   The specified model directory (`model_dir` parameter) will be defined as `AZUREML_MODEL_DIR` variable and retrieved in the scoring script. 
   In this case, we specify the current directory (`./`) since the subdirectory is specified in the scoring script as `model/sklearn_regression_model.pkl`.

    ```bash
    azmlinfsrv --entry_script ./onlinescoring/score.py --model_dir ./
    ```

    The example [startup log](#startup-logs) will be shown if the server launched and the scoring script invoked successfully. Otherwise, there will be error messages in the log.

1. Test the scoring script with a sample data.
    Open another terminal and move to the same working directory to run the command.
    Use the `curl` command to send an example request to the server and receive a scoring result.

    ```bash
    curl --request POST "127.0.0.1:5001/score" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @sample-request.json
    ```

    The scoring result will be returned if there's no problem in your scoring script. If you find something wrong, you can try to update the scoring script, and launch the server again to test the updated script.

## Server Routes

The server is listening on port 5001 (as default) at these routes.

| Name              | Route                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Liveness Probe    | 127.0.0.1:5001/             |
| Score             | 127.0.0.1:5001/score        |
| OpenAPI (swagger) | 127.0.0.1:5001/swagger.json |

## Server parameters

The following table contains the parameters accepted by the server:

| Parameter                       | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| entry_script                    | True     | N/A     | The relative or absolute path to the scoring script.                                                               |
| model_dir                       | False    | N/A     | The relative or absolute path to the directory holding the model used for inferencing.                             |
| port                            | False    | 5001    | The serving port of the server.                                                                                    |

| appinsights_instrumentation_key | False    | N/A     | The instrumentation key to the application insights where the logs will be published.                              |
| access_control_allow_origins    | False    | N/A     | Enable CORS for the specified origins. Separate multiple origins with ",". <br> Example: "microsoft.com, bing.com" |

> [!TIP]
> CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) is a way to allow resources on a webpage to be requested from another domain. CORS works via HTTP headers sent with the client request and returned with the service response. For more information on CORS and valid headers, see [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) in Wikipedia. See [here](v1/how-to-deploy-advanced-entry-script.md#cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors) for an example of the scoring script.

## Request flow

The following steps explain how the Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server (azmlinfsrv) handles incoming requests:

1. A Python CLI wrapper sits around the server's network stack and is used to start the server.
1. A client sends a request to the server.
1. When a request is received, it goes through the [WSGI](https://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html) server and is then dispatched to one of the workers.
    - [Gunicorn](https://docs.gunicorn.org/) is used on __Linux__.
    - [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/) is used on __Windows__.
1. The requests are then handled by a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) app, which loads the entry script & any dependencies.
1. Finally, the request is sent to your entry script. The entry script then makes an inference call to the loaded model and returns a response.

## Understanding logs

Here we describe logs of the AzureML Inference HTTP Server. You can get the log when you run the `azureml-inference-server-http` locally, or [get container logs](how-to-troubleshoot-online-endpoints.md#get-container-logs) if you're using online endpoints. 

> [!NOTE]
> The logging format has changed since version 0.8.0. If you find your log in different style, update the `azureml-inference-server-http` package to the latest version.

> [!TIP]
> If you are using online endpoints, the log from the inference server starts with `Azure ML Inferencing HTTP server <version>`.

### Startup logs

When the server is started, the server settings are first displayed by the logs as follows:

```
Azure ML Inferencing HTTP server <version>


Server Settings
---------------
Entry Script Name: <entry_script>
Model Directory: <model_dir>
Worker Count: <worker_count>
Worker Timeout (seconds): None
Server Port: <port>

```


### Log format

The logs from the inference server are generated in the following format, except for the launcher scripts since they aren't part of the python package: 

`<UTC Time> | <level> [<pid>] <logger name> - <message>`

Here `<pid>` is the process ID and `<level>` is the first character of the [logging level](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels) – E for ERROR, I for INFO, etc.  

There are six levels of logging in Python, with numbers associated with severity:

| Logging level | Numeric value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CRITICAL      | 50            |
| ERROR         | 40            |
| WARNING       | 30            |
| INFO          | 20            |
| DEBUG         | 10            |
| NOTSET        | 0             |
