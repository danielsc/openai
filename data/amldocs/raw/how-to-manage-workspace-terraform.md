# Manage Azure Machine Learning workspaces using Terraform

In this article, you learn how to create and manage an Azure Machine Learning workspace using Terraform configuration files. [Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/)'s template-based configuration files enable you to define, create, and configure Azure resources in a repeatable and predictable manner. Terraform tracks resource state and is able to clean up and destroy resources. 

A Terraform configuration is a document that defines the resources that are needed for a deployment. It may also specify deployment variables. Variables are used to provide input values when using the configuration.

## Prerequisites

* An **Azure subscription**. If you don't have one, try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An installed version of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/).
* Configure Terraform: follow the directions in this article and the [Terraform and configure access to Azure](/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-cloud-shell) article.

## Limitations

[!INCLUDE [register-namespace](../../includes/machine-learning-register-namespace.md)]

[!INCLUDE [application-insight](../../includes/machine-learning-application-insight.md)]

## Declare the Azure provider

Create the Terraform configuration file that declares the Azure provider:

1. Create a new file named `main.tf`. If working with Azure Cloud Shell, use bash:

    ```bash
    code main.tf
    ```

1. Paste the following code into the editor:

    **main.tf**:
    :::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/101-machine-learning/main.tf":::

1. Save the file (**&lt;Ctrl>S**) and exit the editor (**&lt;Ctrl>Q**).

## Deploy a workspace

The following Terraform configurations can be used to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace. When you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, various other services are required as dependencies. The template also specifies these [associated resources to the workspace](./concept-workspace.md#associated-resources). Depending on your needs, you can choose to use the template that creates resources with either public or private network connectivity.

# [Public network connectivity](#tab/publicworkspace)

Some resources in Azure require globally unique names. Before deploying your resources using the following templates, set the `name` variable to a value that is unique.

**variables.tf**:
:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/101-machine-learning/variables.tf":::

**workspace.tf**:
:::code language="terraform" source="~/terraform/quickstart/101-machine-learning/workspace.tf":::

# [Private network connectivity](#tab/privateworkspace)

The configuration below creates a workspace in an isolated network environment using Azure Private Link endpoints. [Private DNS zones](../dns/private-dns-privatednszone.md) are included so domain names can be resolved within the virtual network.

Some resources in Azure require globally unique names. Before deploying your resources using the following templates, set the `resourceprefix` variable to a value that is unique.

When using private link endpoints for both Azure Container Registry and Azure Machine Learning, Azure Container Registry tasks cannot be used for building [environment](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.environment) images. Instead you can build images using an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster. To configure the cluster name of use, set the [image_build_compute_name](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/machine_learning_workspace) argument. You can configure to [allow public access](./how-to-configure-private-link.md?tabs=python#enable-public-access) to a workspace that has a private link endpoint using the [public_network_access_enabled](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/machine_learning_workspace) argument.

**network.tf**:

  name                = "vnet-${var.name}-${var.environment}"

  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "snet-training" {
  name                                           = "snet-training"

resource "azurerm_subnet" "snet-aks" {
  name                                           = "snet-aks"
  resource_group_name                            = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
  virtual_network_name                           = azurerm_virtual_network.default.name
  address_prefixes                               = var.aks_subnet_address_space
  enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = true

resource "azurerm_subnet" "snet-workspace" {
  name                                           = "snet-workspace"
  resource_group_name                            = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
  virtual_network_name                           = azurerm_virtual_network.default.name
  address_prefixes                               = var.ml_subnet_address_space
  enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = true
}

There are several options to connect to your private link endpoint workspace. To learn more about these options, refer to [Securely connect to your workspace](./how-to-secure-workspace-vnet.md#securely-connect-to-your-workspace).
