# Submit Spark jobs in Azure Machine Learning (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview disclaimer](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

Azure Machine Learning supports submission of standalone machine learning jobs, and creation of [machine learning pipelines](./concept-ml-pipelines.md), that involve multiple machine learning workflow steps. Azure Machine Learning handles both standalone Spark job creation, and creation of reusable Spark components that Azure Machine Learning pipelines can use. In this article, you'll learn how to submit Spark jobs using:
- Azure Machine Learning Studio UI
- Azure Machine Learning CLI
- Azure Machine Learning SDK

## Ensuring resource access for Spark jobs
Spark jobs can use either user identity passthrough, or a managed identity, to access data and other resources. The following table summarizes the different mechanisms for resource access while using Azure Machine Learning Managed (Automatic) Spark compute and attached Synapse Spark pool.

|Spark pool|Supported identities|Default identity|
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
|Managed (Automatic) Spark compute|User identity and managed identity|User identity|
|Attached Synapse Spark pool|User identity and managed identity|Managed identity - compute identity of the attached Synapse Spark pool|

If the CLI or SDK code defines an option to use managed identity, Azure Machine Learning Managed (Automatic) Spark compute uses user-assigned managed identity attached to the workspace. You can attach a user-assigned managed identity to an existing Azure Machine Learning workspace using Azure Machine Learning CLI v2, or with `ARMClient`.

### Attach user assigned managed identity using CLI v2
1. Create a YAML file that defines the user-assigned managed identity that should be attached to the workspace:
    ```yaml
    identity:
      type: system_assigned,user_assigned
      tenant_id: <TENANT_ID>
      user_assigned_identities:
        '/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<AML_USER_MANAGED_ID>':
          {}
    ```
1. With the `--file` parameter, use the YAML file in the `az ml workspace update` command to attach the user assigned managed identity:
    ```azurecli
    az ml workspace update --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <AML_WORKSPACE_NAME> --file <YAML_FILE_NAME>.yaml
    ```

### Attach user assigned managed identity using `ARMClient`
1. Install [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient), a simple command line tool that invokes the Azure Resource Manager API.
1. Create a JSON file that defines the user-assigned managed identity that should be attached to the workspace:
    ```json
    {
        "properties":{
        },
        "location": "<AZURE_REGION>",
        "identity":{
            "type":"SystemAssigned,UserAssigned",
            "userAssignedIdentities":{
                "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<AML_USER_MANAGED_ID>": { }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
1. Execute the following command in the PowerShell prompt or the command prompt, to attach the user-assigned managed identity to the workspace.
    ```cmd
    armclient PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>?api-version=2022-05-01 '@<JSON_FILE_NAME>.json'
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> - To ensure successful execution of the Spark job, assign the **Contributor** and **Storage Blob Data Contributor** roles, on the Azure storage account used for data input and output, to the identity that the Spark job uses
> - If an [attached Synapse Spark pool](./how-to-manage-synapse-spark-pool.md) points to a Synapse Spark pool, in an Azure Synapse workspace that has a managed virtual network associated with it, [a managed private endpoint to storage account should be configured](../synapse-analytics/security/connect-to-a-secure-storage-account.md) to ensure data access.

## Submit a standalone Spark job
A Python script developed by [interactive data wrangling](./interactive-data-wrangling-with-apache-spark-azure-ml.md) can be used to submit a batch job to process a larger volume of data, after making necessary changes for Python script parameterization. A simple data wrangling batch job can be submitted as a standalone Spark job.

A Spark job requires a Python script that takes arguments, which can be developed with modification of the Python code developed from [interactive data wrangling](./interactive-data-wrangling-with-apache-spark-azure-ml.md). A sample Python script is shown here.

```python
# titanic.py
import argparse
from operator import add
import pyspark.pandas as pd
from pyspark.ml.feature import Imputer

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--titanic_data")
parser.add_argument("--wrangled_data")

args = parser.parse_args()
print(args.wrangled_data)
print(args.titanic_data)

df = pd.read_csv(args.titanic_data, index_col="PassengerId")
imputer = Imputer(inputCols=["Age"], outputCol="Age").setStrategy(
    "mean"
)  # Replace missing values in Age column with the mean value
df.fillna(
    value={"Cabin": "None"}, inplace=True
)  # Fill Cabin column with value "None" if missing
df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Drop the rows which still have any missing value
df.to_csv(args.wrangled_data, index_col="PassengerId")
```

> [!NOTE]
> This Python code sample uses `pyspark.pandas`, which is only supported by Spark runtime version 3.2.

The above script takes two arguments `--titanic_data` and `--wrangled_data`, which pass the path of input data and output folder respectively.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

To create a job, a standalone Spark job can be defined as a YAML specification file, which can be used in the `az ml job create` command, with the `--file` parameter. Define these properties in the YAML file as follows:

### YAML properties in the Spark job specification
- `type` - set to `spark`.
- `code` - defines the location of the folder that contains source code and scripts for this job.
- `entry` - defines the entry point for the job. It should cover one of these properties:
  - `file` - defines the name of the Python script that serves as an entry point for the job.
  - `class_name` - defines the name of the class that serves as an entry point for the job.
- `py_files` - defines a list of `.zip`, `.egg`, or `.py` files, to be placed in the `PYTHONPATH`, for successful execution of the job. This property is optional.
- `jars` - defines a list of `.jar` files to include on the Spark driver, and the executor `CLASSPATH`, for successful execution of the job. This property is optional.
- `files` - defines a list of files that should be copied to the working directory of each executor, for successful job execution. This property is optional.
- `archives` - defines a list of archives that should be extracted into the working directory of each executor, for successful job execution. This property is optional.
- `conf` - defines these Spark driver and executor properties:
  - `spark.driver.cores`: the number of cores for the Spark driver.
  - `spark.driver.memory`: allocated memory for the Spark driver, in gigabytes (GB).
  - `spark.executor.cores`: the number of cores for the Spark executor.
  - `spark.executor.memory`: the memory allocation for the Spark executor, in gigabytes (GB).
  - `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled` - whether or not executors should be dynamically allocated, as a `True` or `False` value.
  -   If dynamic allocation of executors is enabled, define these properties:
      - `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors` - the minimum number of Spark executors instances, for dynamic allocation.
      - `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors` - the maximum number of Spark executors instances, for dynamic allocation.
  -   If dynamic allocation of executors is disabled, define this property:
      - `spark.executor.instances` - the number of Spark executor instances.
- `environment` - an [Azure Machine Learning environment](./reference-yaml-environment.md) to run the job.
- `args` - the command line arguments that should be passed to the job entry point Python script or class. See the YAML specification file provided here for an example.
- `resources` - this property defines the resources to be used by an Azure Machine Learning Managed (Automatic) Spark compute. It uses the following properties:
  - `instance_type` - the compute instance type to be used for Spark pool. The following instance types are currently supported:
    - `standard_e4s_v3`
    - `standard_e8s_v3`
    - `standard_e16s_v3`
    - `standard_e32s_v3`
    - `standard_e64s_v3`
  - `runtime_version` - defines the Spark runtime version. The following Spark runtime versions are currently supported:
    - `3.1`
    - `3.2`

  An example is shown here:
  ```yaml
  resources:
    instance_type: standard_e8s_v3
    runtime_version: "3.2"
  ```
- `compute` - this property defines the name of an attached Synapse Spark pool, as shown in this example:
  ```yaml
  compute: mysparkpool
  ```
- `inputs` - this property defines inputs for the Spark job. Inputs for a Spark job can be either a literal value, or data stored in a file or folder.
  - A **literal value** can be a number, a boolean value or a string. Some examples are shown here:
      ```yaml
      inputs:
        sampling_rate: 0.02 # a number
        hello_number: 42 # an integer
        hello_string: "Hello world" # a string
        hello_boolean: True # a boolean value
      ```
  - **Data** stored in a file or folder should be defined using these properties:
    - `type` - set this property to `uri_file`, or `uri_folder`, for input data contained in a file or a folder respectively.
    - `path` - the URI of the input data, such as `azureml://`, `abfss://`, or `wasbs://`.
    - `mode` - set this property to `direct`.
      This sample shows the definition of a job input, which can be referred to as `$${inputs.titanic_data}}`:
      ```YAML
      inputs:
        titanic_data:
          type: uri_file
          path: azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/titanic.csv
          mode: direct
      ```
- `outputs` - this property defines the Spark job outputs. Outputs for a Spark job can be written to either a file or a folder location, which is defined using the following three properties:
  - `type` - this property can be set to `uri_file` or `uri_folder` for writing output data to a file or a folder respectively.
  - `path` - this property defines the output location URI, such as `azureml://`, `abfss://`, or `wasbs://`.
  - `mode` - set this property to `direct`.
    This sample shows the definition of a job output, which can be referred to as `${{outputs.wrangled_data}}`:
    ```YAML
    outputs:
      wrangled_data:
        type: uri_folder
        path: azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/wrangled/
        mode: direct
    ```
- `identity` - this optional property defines the identity used to submit this job. It can have `user_identity` and `managed` values. If no identity is defined in the YAML specification, the default identity will be used.
 
### Standalone Spark job
This example YAML specification shows a standalone Spark job. It uses an Azure Machine Learning Managed (Automatic) Spark compute:

```yaml
$schema: http://azureml/sdk-2-0/SparkJob.json
type: spark

code: ./ 
entry:
  file: titanic.py

conf:
  spark.driver.cores: 1
  spark.driver.memory: 2g
  spark.executor.cores: 2
  spark.executor.memory: 2g
  spark.executor.instances: 2

inputs:
  titanic_data:
    type: uri_file
    path: azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/titanic.csv
    mode: direct

outputs:
  wrangled_data:
    type: uri_folder
    path: azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/wrangled/
    mode: direct

args: >-
  --titanic_data ${{inputs.titanic_data}}
  --wrangled_data ${{outputs.wrangled_data}}

identity:
  type: user_identity

resources:
  instance_type: standard_e4s_v3
  runtime_version: "3.2"
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use an attached Synapse Spark pool, define the `compute` property in the sample YAML specification file shown above, instead of the `resources` property.

The YAML files shown above can be used in the `az ml job create` command, with the `--file` parameter, to create a standalone Spark job as shown:

```azurecli
az ml job create --file <YAML_SPECIFICATION_FILE_NAME>.yaml --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --workspace-name <AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>
```

You can execute the above command from:
- [terminal of an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](how-to-access-terminal.md#access-a-terminal). 
- terminal of [Visual Studio Code connected to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](./how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md?tabs=studio).
- your local computer that has [Azure Machine Learning CLI](./how-to-configure-cli.md?tabs=public) installed.

You can submit a standalone Spark job from:
- an Azure Machine Learning Notebook connected to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance. 
- [Visual Studio Code connected to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](./how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md?tabs=studio).
- your local computer that has [the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-ml-readme) installed.

This Python code snippet shows the creation of a standalone Spark job, with an Azure Machine Learning Managed (Automatic) Spark compute, using user identity.

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient, spark, Input, Output
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.ml.entities import UserIdentityConfiguration

subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
workspace_name = "<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>"
ml_client = MLClient(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace_name
)

spark_job = spark(
    display_name="Titanic-Spark-Job-SDK",
    code="./src",
    entry={"file": "titanic.py"},
    driver_cores=1,
    driver_memory="2g",
    executor_cores=2,
    executor_memory="2g",
    executor_instances=2,
    resources={
        "instance_type": "Standard_E8S_V3",
        "runtime_version": "3.2.0",
    },
    inputs={
        "titanic_data": Input(
            type="uri_file",
            path="azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/titanic.csv",
            mode="direct",
        ),
    },
    outputs={
        "wrangled_data": Output(
            type="uri_folder",
            path="azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/wrangled/",
            mode="direct",
        ),
    },
    identity=UserIdentityConfiguration(),
    args="--titanic_data ${{inputs.titanic_data}} --wrangled_data ${{outputs.wrangled_data}}",
)

returned_spark_job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(spark_job)

# Wait until the job completes
ml_client.jobs.stream(returned_spark_job.name)
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use an attached Synapse Spark pool, define the `compute` parameter in the `azure.ai.ml.spark` function, instead of `resources`.

## Spark component in a pipeline job
A Spark component offers the flexibility to use the same component in multiple [Azure Machine Learning pipelines](./concept-ml-pipelines.md), as a pipeline step.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

YAML syntax for a Spark component resembles the [YAML syntax for Spark job specification](#yaml-properties-in-the-spark-job-specification) in most ways. These properties are defined differently in the Spark component YAML specification:
- `name` - the name of the Spark component.
- `version` - the version of the Spark component.
- `display_name` - the name of the Spark component to display in the UI and elsewhere.
- `description` - the description of the Spark component.
- `inputs` - this property is similar to `inputs` property described in [YAML syntax for Spark job specification](#yaml-properties-in-the-spark-job-specification), except that it doesn't define the `path` property. This code snippet shows an example of the Spark component `inputs` property:

  ```yaml
  inputs:
    titanic_data:
      type: uri_file
      mode: direct
  ```

- `outputs` - this property is similar to the `outputs` property described in [YAML syntax for Spark job specification](#yaml-properties-in-the-spark-job-specification), except that it doesn't define the `path` property. This code snippet shows an example of the Spark component `outputs` property:

  ```yaml
  outputs:
    wrangled_data:
      type: uri_folder
      mode: direct
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> A Spark component does not define `identity`, `compute` or `resources` properties. The pipeline YAML specification file defines these properties.

This YAML specification file provides an example of a Spark component:

```yaml
$schema: http://azureml/sdk-2-0/SparkComponent.json
name: titanic_spark_component
type: spark
version: 1
display_name: Titanic-Spark-Component
description: Spark component for Titanic data

code: ./src
entry:
  file: titanic.py

inputs:
  titanic_data:
    type: uri_file
    mode: direct

outputs:
  wrangled_data:
    type: uri_folder
    mode: direct

args: >-
  --titanic_data ${{inputs.titanic_data}}
  --wrangled_data ${{outputs.wrangled_data}}

conf:
  spark.driver.cores: 1
  spark.driver.memory: 2g
  spark.executor.cores: 2
  spark.executor.memory: 2g
  spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled: True
  spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors: 1
  spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors: 4
```

The Spark component defined in the above YAML specification file can be used in an Azure Machine Learning pipeline job. See [pipeline job YAML schema](./reference-yaml-job-pipeline.md) to learn more about the YAML syntax that defines a pipeline job. This example shows a YAML specification file for a pipeline job, with a Spark component, and an Azure Machine Learning Managed (Automatic) Spark compute:

```yaml
$schema: http://azureml/sdk-2-0/PipelineJob.json
type: pipeline
display_name: Titanic-Spark-CLI-Pipeline
description: Spark component for Titanic data in Pipeline

jobs:
  spark_job:
    type: spark
    component: ./spark-job-component.yaml
    inputs:
      titanic_data: 
        type: uri_file
        path: azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/titanic.csv
        mode: direct

    outputs:
      wrangled_data:
        type: uri_folder
        path: azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/wrangled/
        mode: direct

    identity:
      type: managed

    resources:
      instance_type: standard_e8s_v3
      runtime_version: "3.2"
```
> [!NOTE]
> To use an attached Synapse Spark pool, define the `compute` property in the sample YAML specification file shown above, instead of `resources` property.

The above YAML specification file can be used in `az ml job create` command, using the `--file` parameter, to create a pipeline job as shown:

```azurecli
az ml job create --file <YAML_SPECIFICATION_FILE_NAME>.yaml --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --workspace-name <AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>
```

You can execute the above command from:
- [terminal of an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](how-to-access-terminal.md#access-a-terminal). 
- terminal of [Visual Studio Code connected to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](./how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md?tabs=studio).
- your local computer that has [Azure Machine Learning CLI](./how-to-configure-cli.md?tabs=public) installed.

# [Python SDK](#tab/sdk)
[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](../../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

To create an Azure Machine Learning pipeline with a Spark component, you should have familiarity with creation of [Azure Machine Learning pipelines from components, using Python SDK](./tutorial-pipeline-python-sdk.md#create-the-pipeline-from-components). A Spark component is created using `azure.ai.ml.spark` function. The function parameters are defined almost the same way as for the [standalone Spark job](#standalone-spark-job-using-python-sdk). These parameters are defined differently for the Spark component:

- `name` - the name of the Spark component.
- `display_name` - the name of the Spark component that will display in the UI and elsewhere.
- `inputs` - this parameter is similar to `inputs` parameter described for the [standalone Spark job](#standalone-spark-job-using-python-sdk), except that the `azure.ai.ml.Input` class is instantiated without the `path` parameter.
- `outputs` - this parameter is similar to `outputs` parameter described for the [standalone Spark job](#standalone-spark-job-using-python-sdk), except that the `azure.ai.ml.Output` class is instantiated without the `path` parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> A Spark component created using `azure.ai.ml.spark` function does not define `identity`,  `compute` or `resources` parameters. The Azure Machine Learning pipeline defines these parameters.

You can submit a pipeline job with a Spark component from:
- an Azure Machine Learning Notebook connected to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance. 
- [Visual Studio Code connected to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](./how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote.md?tabs=studio).
- your local computer that has [the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-ml-readme) installed.

This Python code snippet shows use of a managed identity, together with the creation of an Azure Machine Learning pipeline job. Additionally, it shows use of a Spark component and an Azure Machine Learning Managed (Automatic) Synapse compute:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient, dsl, spark, Input, Output
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedIdentityConfiguration
from azure.ai.ml.constants import InputOutputModes

subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
workspace_name = "<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>"
ml_client = MLClient(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace_name
)

spark_component = spark(
    name="Spark Component",
    inputs={
        "titanic_data": Input(type="uri_file", mode="direct"),
    },
    outputs={
        "wrangled_data": Output(type="uri_folder", mode="direct"),
    },
    # The source folder of the component
    code="./src",
    entry={"file": "titanic.py"},
    driver_cores=1,
    driver_memory="2g",
    executor_cores=2,
    executor_memory="2g",
    executor_instances=2,
    args="--titanic_data ${{inputs.titanic_data}} --wrangled_data ${{outputs.wrangled_data}}",
)


@dsl.pipeline(
    description="Sample Pipeline with Spark component",
)
def spark_pipeline(spark_input_data):
    spark_step = spark_component(titanic_data=spark_input_data)
    spark_step.inputs.titanic_data.mode = InputOutputModes.DIRECT
    spark_step.outputs.wrangled_data = Output(
        type="uri_folder",
        path="azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/wrangled/",
    )
    spark_step.outputs.wrangled_data.mode = InputOutputModes.DIRECT
    spark_step.identity = ManagedIdentityConfiguration()
    spark_step.resources = {
        "instance_type": "Standard_E8S_V3",
        "runtime_version": "3.2.0",
    }

pipeline = spark_pipeline(
    spark_input_data=Input(
        type="uri_file",
        path="azureml://datastores/workspaceblobstore/paths/data/titanic.csv",
    )
)

pipeline_job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
    pipeline,
    experiment_name="Titanic-Spark-Pipeline-SDK",
)

# Wait until the job completes
ml_client.jobs.stream(pipeline_job.name)
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use an attached Synapse Spark pool, define the `compute` parameter in the `azure.ai.ml.spark` function, instead of `resources` parameter. For example, in the code sample shown above, define `spark_step.compute = "<ATTACHED_SPARK_POOL_NAME>"` instead of defining `spark_step.resources`.

# [Studio UI](#tab/ui)
This functionality isn't available in the Studio UI. The Studio UI doesn't support this feature.
