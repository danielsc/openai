In this article, learn how to run your [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview) training scripts at scale using Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2.

The example code in this article train a TensorFlow model to classify handwritten digits, using a deep neural network (DNN); register the model; and deploy it to an online endpoint.

Whether you're developing a TensorFlow model from the ground-up or you're bringing an existing model into the cloud, you can use Azure Machine Learning to scale out open-source training jobs using elastic cloud compute resources. You can build, deploy, version, and monitor production-grade models with Azure Machine Learning.

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this article, you'll need to:

- Access an Azure subscription. If you don't have one already, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Run the code in this article using either an Azure Machine Learning compute instance or your own Jupyter notebook.
    - Azure Machine Learning compute instanceâ€”no downloads or installation necessary
        - Complete the [Quickstart: Get started with Azure Machine Learning](quickstart-create-resources.md) to create a dedicated notebook server pre-loaded with the SDK and the sample repository.
        - In the samples deep learning folder on the notebook server, find a completed and expanded notebook by navigating to this directory: **v2  > sdk > python > jobs > single-step > tensorflow > train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow**.
    - Your Jupyter notebook server
        - [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK (v2)](https://aka.ms/sdk-v2-install).
- Download the following files:
    - training script [tf_mnist.py](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/jobs/single-step/tensorflow/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow/src/tf_mnist.py) 
    - scoring script [score.py](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/jobs/single-step/tensorflow/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow/src/score.py)
    - sample request file [sample-request.json](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/jobs/single-step/tensorflow/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow/request/sample-request.json)

You can also find a completed [Jupyter Notebook version](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/jobs/single-step/tensorflow/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow.ipynb) of this guide on the GitHub samples page.

## Set up the job

This section sets up the job for training by loading the required Python packages, connecting to a workspace, creating a compute resource to run a command job, and creating an environment to run the job.

### Connect to the workspace

First, you'll need to connect to your AzureML workspace. The [AzureML workspace](concept-workspace.md) is the top-level resource for the service. It provides you with a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning.

We're using `DefaultAzureCredential` to get access to the workspace. This credential should be capable of handling most Azure SDK authentication scenarios.

If `DefaultAzureCredential` doesn't work for you, see [`azure-identity reference documentation`](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity) or [`Set up authentication`](how-to-setup-authentication.md?tabs=sdk) for more available credentials.

```python
# Handle to the workspace
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient

# Authentication package
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```
