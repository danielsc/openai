An Azure Machine Learning pipeline is an independently executable workflow of a complete machine learning task. An Azure Machine Learning pipeline helps to standardize the best practices of producing a machine learning model, enables the team to execute at scale, and improves the model building efficiency.

## Why are Azure Machine Learning pipelines needed?

The core of a machine learning pipeline is to split a complete machine learning task into a multistep workflow. Each step is a manageable component that can be developed, optimized, configured, and automated individually. Steps are connected through well-defined interfaces. The Azure Machine Learning pipeline service automatically orchestrates all the dependencies between pipeline steps. This modular approach brings two key benefits:
- [Standardize the Machine learning operation (MLOps) practice and support scalable team collaboration](#standardize-the-mlops-practice-and-support-scalable-team-collaboration)
- [Training efficiency and cost reduction](#training-efficiency-and-cost-reduction)

### Standardize the MLOps practice and support scalable team collaboration

Machine learning operation (MLOps) automates the process of building machine learning models and taking the model to production. This is a complex process. It usually requires collaboration from different teams with different skills. A well-defined machine learning pipeline can abstract this complex process into a multiple steps workflow, mapping each step to a specific task such that each team can work independently.  

For example, a typical machine learning project includes the steps of data collection, data preparation, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment. Usually, the data engineers concentrate on data steps, data scientists spend most time on model training and evaluation, the machine learning engineers focus on model deployment and automation of the entire workflow. By leveraging machine learning pipeline, each team only needs to work on building their own steps. The best way of building steps is using [Azure Machine Learning component](concept-component.md), a self-contained piece of code that does one step in a machine learning pipeline. All these steps built by different users are finally integrated into one workflow through the pipeline definition. The pipeline is a collaboration tool for everyone in the project. The process of defining a pipeline and all its steps can be standardized by each company's preferred DevOps practice. The pipeline can be further versioned and automated. If the ML projects are described as a pipeline, then the best MLOps practice is already applied.  

### Training efficiency and cost reduction

Besides being the tool to put MLOps into practice, the machine learning pipeline also improves large model trainingâ€™s efficiency and reduces cost. Taking modern natural language model training as an example. It requires pre-processing large amounts of data and GPU intensive transformer model training. It takes hours to days to train a model each time. When the model is being built, the data scientist wants to test different training code or hyperparameters and run the training many times to get the best model performance. For most of these trainings, there's usually small changes from one training to another one. It will be a significant waste if every time the full training from data processing to model training takes place. By using machine learning pipeline, it can automatically calculate which steps result is unchanged and reuse outputs from previous training. Additionally, the machine learning pipeline supports running each step on different computation resources. Such that, the memory heavy data processing work and run-on high memory CPU machines, and the computation intensive training can run on expensive GPU machines. By properly choosing which step to run on which type of machines, the training cost can be significantly reduced.
