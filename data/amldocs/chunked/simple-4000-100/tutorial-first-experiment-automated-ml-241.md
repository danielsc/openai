Deployment files are larger than data and experiment files, so they cost more to store. Delete only the deployment files to minimize costs to your account, or if you want to keep your workspace and experiment files. Otherwise, delete the entire resource group, if you don't plan to use any of the files.  

### Delete the deployment instance

Delete just the deployment instance from Azure Machine Learning at https:\//ml.azure.com/, if you want to keep the resource group and workspace for other tutorials and exploration. 

1. Go to [Azure Machine Learning](https://ml.azure.com/). Navigate to your workspace and  on the left under the **Assets** pane, select **Endpoints**. 

1. Select the deployment you want to delete and select **Delete**. 

1. Select **Proceed**.
