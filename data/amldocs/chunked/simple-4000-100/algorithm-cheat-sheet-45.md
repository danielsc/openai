In unsupervised learning, data points have no labels associated with them. Instead, the goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to organize the data in some way or to describe its structure. Unsupervised learning groups data into clusters, as K-means does, or finds different ways of looking at complex data so that it appears simpler.

### Reinforcement learning

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm gets to choose an action in response to each data point. It is a common approach in robotics, where the set of sensor readings at one point in time is a data point, and the algorithm must choose the robotâ€™s next action. It's also a natural fit for Internet of Things applications. The learning algorithm also receives a reward signal a short time later, indicating how good the decision was. Based on this signal, the algorithm modifies its strategy in order to achieve the highest reward.
