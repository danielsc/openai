You can filter failed or completed nodes, and filter by only components or dataset for further search. The left pane will show the matched nodes with more information including status, duration, and created time.

You can also sort the filtered nodes.

### Check logs and outputs of component

If your pipeline fails or gets stuck on a node, first view the logs.

1. You can select the specific node and open the right pane.

1. Select **Outputs+logs** tab and you can explore all the outputs and logs of this node.

    The **user_logs folder** contains information about user code generated logs. This folder is open by default, and the **std_log.txt** log is selected. The **std_log.txt** is where your code's logs (for example, print statements) show up.

    The **system_logs folder** contains logs generated by Azure Machine Learning. Learn more about [View and download diagnostic logs](how-to-log-view-metrics.md#view-and-download-diagnostic-logs).

    If you don't see those folders, this is due to the compute run time update isn't released to the compute cluster yet, and you can look at **70_driver_log.txt** under **azureml-logs** folder first.


## Clone a pipeline job to continue editing

If you would like to work based on an existing pipeline job in the workspace, you can easily clone it into a new pipeline draft to continue editing.

After cloning, you can also know which pipeline job it's cloned from by selecting **Show lineage**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-use-pipeline-ui/draft-show-lineage.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the draft lineage after selecting show lineage button." lightbox= "./media/how-to-use-pipeline-ui/draft-show-lineage.png":::

You can edit your pipeline and then submit again. After submitting, you can see the lineage between the job you submit and the original job by selecting **Show lineage** in the job detail page.

## Compare different pipelines to debug failure or other unexpected issues (preview)

Pipeline comparison identifies the differences (including topology, component properties, and job properties) between multiple jobs. For example you can compare a successful pipeline and a failed pipeline, which helps you find what modifications make your pipeline fail.

Two major scenarios where you can use pipeline comparison to help with debugging:

- Debug your failed pipeline job by comparing it to a completed one.
- Debug your failed node in a pipeline by comparing it to a similar completed one.

To enable this feature:

1. Navigate to Azure Machine Learning studio UI.
2. Select **Manage preview features** (megaphone icon) among the icons on the top right side of the screen.
3. In **Managed preview feature** panel, toggle on **Compare pipeline jobs to debug failures or unexpected issues** feature.

### How to debug your failed pipeline job by comparing it to a completed one

During iterative model development, you may have a baseline pipeline, and then do some modifications such as changing a parameter, dataset or compute resource, etc. If your new pipeline failed, you can use pipeline comparison to identify what has changed by comparing it to the baseline pipeline, which could help with figuring out why it failed.
