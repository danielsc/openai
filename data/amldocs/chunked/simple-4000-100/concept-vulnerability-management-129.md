* Automated ML jobs run on environments that layer on top of Azure ML [base docker images](https://github.com/Azure/AzureML-Containers).

 * Designer jobs are compartmentalized into [Components](concept-designer.md#component). Each component has its own environment that layers on top of the Azure ML base docker images. For more information on components, see the [Component reference](./component-reference/component-reference.md).
