### Incompatible Python version
<!--issueDescription-->
This issue can happen when there's a package specified in your conda environment that isn't compatible with your specified Python version.

**Affected areas (symptoms):**
* Failure in building environments from UI, SDK, and CLI.
* Failure in running jobs because it will implicitly build the environment in the first step.
<!--/issueDescription-->

**Troubleshooting steps**

Use a different version of the package that's compatible with your specified Python version

Alternatively, use a different version of Python that's compatible with the package you've specified
* If you're changing your Python version, use a version that's supported and that isn't nearing its end-of-life soon
* See Python [end-of-life dates](https://aka.ms/azureml/environment/python-end-of-life)
