| `outputs` | object | Dictionary of output configurations of the pipeline job. The key is a name for the output within the context of the job and the value is the output configuration. <br><br> These pipeline outputs can be referenced by the outputs of an individual step job in the pipeline using the `${{ parents.outputs.<output_name> }}` expression. For more information on how to bind the inputs of a pipeline step to the inputs of the top-level pipeline job, see the [Expression syntax for binding inputs and outputs between steps in a pipeline job](reference-yaml-core-syntax.md#binding-inputs-and-outputs-between-steps-in-a-pipeline-job). | |
| `outputs.<output_name>` | object | You can leave the object empty, in which case by default the output will be of type `uri_folder` and Azure ML will system-generate an output location for the output based on the following templatized path: `{settings.datastore}/azureml/{job-name}/{output-name}/`. File(s) to the output directory will be written via read-write mount. If you want to specify a different mode for the output, provide an object containing the [job output specification](#job-outputs). | |
| `identity` | object | The identity is used for data accessing. It can be [UserIdentityConfiguration](#useridentityconfiguration), [ManagedIdentityConfiguration](#managedidentityconfiguration) or None. If it's UserIdentityConfiguration the identity of job submitter will be used to access input data and write result to output folder, otherwise, the managed identity of the compute target will be used. | |

### Attributes of the `settings` key

| Key | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `default_datastore` | string | Name of the datastore to use as the default datastore for the pipeline job. This value must be a reference to an existing datastore in the workspace using the `azureml:<datastore-name>` syntax. Any outputs defined in the `outputs` property of the parent pipeline job or child step jobs will be stored in this datastore. If omitted, outputs will be stored in the workspace blob datastore. | |
| `default_compute` | string | Name of the compute target to use as the default compute for all steps in the pipeline. If compute is defined at the step level, it will override this default compute for that specific step. This value must be a reference to an existing compute in the workspace using the `azureml:<compute-name>` syntax. | |
| `continue_on_step_failure` | boolean | Whether the execution of steps in the pipeline should continue if one step fails. The default value is `False`, which means that if one step fails, the pipeline execution will be stopped, canceling any running steps. | `False` |
| `force_rerun` | boolean | Whether to force rerun the whole pipeline. The default value is `False`, which means by default the pipeline will try to reuse the previous job's output if it meets reuse criteria. If set as `True`, all steps in the pipeline will rerun.| `False` |

### Job inputs

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `type` | string | The type of job input. Specify `uri_file` for input data that points to a single file source, or `uri_folder` for input data that points to a folder source. [Learn more about data access.](concept-data.md)| `uri_file`, `uri_folder`, `mltable`, `mlflow_model` | `uri_folder` |
| `path` | string | The path to the data to use as input. This can be specified in a few ways: <br><br> - A local path to the data source file or folder, e.g. `path: ./iris.csv`. The data will get uploaded during job submission. <br><br> - A URI of a cloud path to the file or folder to use as the input. Supported URI types are `azureml`, `https`, `wasbs`, `abfss`, `adl`. See [Core yaml syntax](reference-yaml-core-syntax.md) for more information on how to use the `azureml://` URI format. <br><br> - An existing registered Azure ML data asset to use as the input. To reference a registered data asset use the `azureml:<data_name>:<data_version>` syntax or `azureml:<data_name>@latest` (to reference the latest version of that data asset), e.g. `path: azureml:cifar10-data:1` or `path: azureml:cifar10-data@latest`. | | |
