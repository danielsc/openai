The heatmap visualizes cells with high error by using a darker red color to bring the user's attention to those regions. This feature is especially beneficial when the error themes are different across partitions, which happens often in practice. In this error identification view, the analysis is highly guided by the users and their knowledge or hypotheses of what features might be most important for understanding failures.
