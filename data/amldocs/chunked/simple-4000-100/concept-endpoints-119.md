Managed online endpoints help to deploy your ML models in a turnkey manner. Managed online endpoints work with powerful CPU and GPU machines in Azure in a scalable, fully managed way. Managed online endpoints take care of serving, scaling, securing, and monitoring your models, freeing you from the overhead of setting up and managing the underlying infrastructure. The main example in this doc uses managed online endpoints for deployment. 

Kubernetes online endpoint allows you to deploy models and serve online endpoints at your fully configured and managed [Kubernetes cluster anywhere](./how-to-attach-kubernetes-anywhere.md),with CPUs or GPUs.

The following table highlights the key differences between managed online endpoints and Kubernetes online endpoints.
