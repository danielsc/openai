# Prebuilt Docker images for inference

Prebuilt Docker container images for inference are used when deploying a model with Azure Machine Learning.  The images are prebuilt with popular machine learning frameworks and Python packages. You can also extend the packages to add other packages by using one of the following methods:

## Why should I use prebuilt images?

* Reduces model deployment latency.
* Improves model deployment success rate.
* Avoid unnecessary image build during model deployment.
* Only have required dependencies and access right in the image/container.
