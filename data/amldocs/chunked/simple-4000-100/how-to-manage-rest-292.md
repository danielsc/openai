You should receive a `202 Accepted` response and, in the returned headers, a `Location` URI. You can GET this URI for information on the deployment, including helpful debugging information if there's a problem with one of your dependent resources (for instance, if you forgot to enable admin access on your container registry). 

## Create a workspace using a user-assigned managed identity 

When creating workspace, you can specify a user-assigned managed identity that will be used to access the associated resources: ACR, KeyVault, Storage, and App Insights. To create a workspace with user-assigned managed identity, use the below request body. 

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>\
/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<YOUR-NEW-WORKSPACE-NAME>?api-version=2022-05-01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "location": "AZURE-LOCATION>",
    "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned,UserAssigned",
      "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<YOUR-MANAGED-IDENTITY>": {}
      }
    },
    "properties": {
        "friendlyName" : "<YOUR-WORKSPACE-FRIENDLY-NAME>",
        "description" : "<YOUR-WORKSPACE-DESCRIPTION>",
        "containerRegistry" : "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<YOUR-REGISTRY-NAME>",
        keyVault" : "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>\
/providers/Microsoft.Keyvault/vaults/<YOUR-KEYVAULT-NAME>",
        "applicationInsights" : "subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.insights/components/<YOUR-APPLICATION-INSIGHTS-NAME>",
        "storageAccount" : "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>"
    }
}'
```

## Create a workspace using customer-managed encryption keys

By default, metadata for the workspace is stored in an Azure Cosmos DB instance that Microsoft maintains. This data is encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys. Instead of using the Microsoft-managed key, you can also provide your own key. Doing so creates an [another set of resources](./concept-data-encryption.md#azure-cosmos-db) in your Azure subscription to store your data.

To create a workspace that uses your keys for encryption, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

* The Azure Machine Learning service principal must have contributor access to your Azure subscription.
* You must have an existing Azure Key Vault that contains an encryption key.
* The Azure Key Vault must exist in the same Azure region where you'll create the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
* The Azure Key Vault must have soft delete and purge protection enabled to protect against data loss if there was accidental deletion.
* You must have an access policy in Azure Key Vault that grants get, wrap, and unwrap access to the Azure Cosmos DB application.

To create a workspace that uses a user-assigned managed identity and customer-managed keys for encryption, use the below request body. When using a user-assigned managed identity for the workspace, also set the `userAssignedIdentity` property to the resource ID of the managed identity.

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>\
/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<YOUR-NEW-WORKSPACE-NAME>?api-version=2022-05-01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "location": "eastus2euap",
    "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned"
    },
    "properties": {
      "friendlyName": "<YOUR-WORKSPACE-FRIENDLY-NAME>",
      "description": "<YOUR-WORKSPACE-DESCRIPTION>",
      "containerRegistry" : "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<YOUR-REGISTRY-NAME>",
      "keyVault" : "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>\
/providers/Microsoft.Keyvault/vaults/<YOUR-KEYVAULT-NAME>",
      "applicationInsights" : "subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.insights/components/<YOUR-APPLICATION-INSIGHTS-NAME>",
      "storageAccount" : "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>",
      "encryption": {
        "status": "Enabled",
        "identity": {
          "userAssignedIdentity": null
        },      
        "keyVaultProperties": {
           "keyVaultArmId": "/subscriptions/<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>/\
providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<YOUR-VAULT>",
           "keyIdentifier": "https://<YOUR-VAULT>.vault.azure.net/keys/<YOUR-KEY>/<YOUR-KEY-VERSION>",
           "identityClientId": ""
        }
      },
      "hbiWorkspace": false
    }
}'
```
