## Datasets

When you create a new pipeline in Azure Machine Learning designer, a number of sample datasets are included by default. These sample datasets are used by the sample pipelines in the designer homepage. 

The sample datasets are available under **Datasets**-**Samples** category. You can find this in the component palette to the left of the canvas in the designer. You can use any of these datasets in your own pipeline by dragging it to the canvas.

|-------------|:--------------------|
| Adult Census Income Binary Classification dataset | A subset of the 1994 Census database, using working adults over the age of 16 with an adjusted income index of > 100.<br/>**Usage**: Classify people using demographics to predict whether a person earns over 50K a year.<br/> **Related Research**: Kohavi, R., Becker, B., (1996). [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science|
|Automobile price data (Raw)|Information about automobiles by make and model, including the price, features such as the number of cylinders and MPG, as well as an insurance risk score.<br/> The risk score is initially associated with auto price. It is then adjusted for actual risk in a process known to actuaries as symboling. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, and a value of -3 that it is probably safe.<br/>**Usage**: Predict the risk score by features, using regression or multivariate classification.<br/>**Related Research**: Schlimmer, J.C. (1987). [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science. |
