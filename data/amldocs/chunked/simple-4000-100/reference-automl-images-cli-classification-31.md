| `limits` | object | Dictionary of limit configurations of the job. The key is name for the limit within the context of the job and the value is limit value. For more information, see [Configure your experiment settings](./how-to-auto-train-image-models.md?tabs=cli#job-limits) section. | | |
| `training_parameters` | object | Dictionary containing training parameters for the job. Provide an object that has keys as listed in following sections. <br> - [Model agnostic hyperparameters](./reference-automl-images-hyperparameters.md#model-agnostic-hyperparameters) <br> - [Image classification (multi-class and multi-label) specific hyperparameters](./reference-automl-images-hyperparameters.md#image-classification-multi-class-and-multi-label-specific-hyperparameters). <br> <br> For an example, see [Supported model architectures](./how-to-auto-train-image-models.md?tabs=cli#supported-model-architectures) section. | | |
| `sweep` | object | Dictionary containing sweep parameters for the job. It has two keys - `sampling_algorithm` (**required**) and `early_termination`. For more information and an example, see [Sampling methods for the sweep](./how-to-auto-train-image-models.md?tabs=cli#sampling-methods-for-the-sweep), [Early termination policies](./how-to-auto-train-image-models.md?tabs=cli#early-termination-policies) sections. | | |
| `search_space` | object | Dictionary of the hyperparameter search space. The key is the name of the hyperparameter and the value is the parameter expression. The user can find the possible hyperparameters from parameters specified for `training_parameters` key. For an example, see [Sweeping hyperparameters for your model](./how-to-auto-train-image-models.md?tabs=cli#manually-sweeping-model-hyperparameters) section. | | |
| `search_space.<hyperparameter>` | object | There are two types of hyperparameters: <br> - **Discrete Hyperparameters**: Discrete hyperparameters are specified as a [`choice`](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#choice) among discrete values. `choice` can be one or more comma-separated values, a `range` object, or any arbitrary `list` object. Advanced discrete hyperparameters can also be specified using a distribution - [`randint`](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#randint), [`qlognormal`, `qnormal`](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#qlognormal-qnormal), [`qloguniform`, `quniform`](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#qloguniform-quniform). For more information, see this [section](./how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#discrete-hyperparameters). <br> - **Continuous hyperparameters**: Continuous hyperparameters are specified as a distribution over a continuous range of values. Currently supported distributions are - [`lognormal`, `normal`](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#lognormal-normal), [`loguniform`](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#loguniform), [`uniform`](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#uniform). For more information, see this [section](./how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#continuous-hyperparameters). <br> <br> See [Parameter expressions](./reference-yaml-job-sweep.md#parameter-expressions) for the set of possible expressions to use.  | | |
| `outputs` | object | Dictionary of output configurations of the job. The key is a name for the output within the context of the job and the value is the output configuration. | | |
| `outputs.best_model` | object | Dictionary of output configurations for best model. For more information, see [Best model output configuration](#best-model-output-configuration). | | |


### Training or validation data

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `description` | string | The detailed information that describes this input data. | | |
| `path` | string | Path can be a `file` path, `folder` path or `pattern` for paths. `pattern` specifies a search pattern to allow globbing(`*` and `**`) of files and folders containing data. Supported URI types are `azureml`, `https`, `wasbs`, `abfss`, and `adl`. For more information on how to use the `azureml://` URI format, see [Core yaml syntax](./reference-yaml-core-syntax.md). URI of the location of the artifact file. If this URI doesn't have a scheme (for example, http:, azureml: etc.), then it's considered a local reference and the file it points to is uploaded to the default workspace blob-storage as the entity is created.  | | |
