## Enter into a contract 

After you have selected the labeling company you want to work with, you need to enter into a contract directly with the labeling company setting forth the terms of your engagement. Microsoft is not a party to this agreement and plays no role in determining or negotiating its terms. Amounts payable under this agreement will be paid directly to the labeling company.

If you enable ML Assisted labeling in a labeling project, Microsoft will charge you separately for the compute resources consumed in connection with this service. All other charges associated with your use of Azure Machine Learning (such as storage of data used in your Azure Machine Learning workspace) are governed by the terms of your agreement with Microsoft.

## Enable access

In order for the vendor labeling company to have access into your projects, you'll next [add them as labelers to your project](how-to-add-users.md).  If you are planning to use multiple vendor labeling companies for different labeling projects, we recommend you create separate workspaces for each company.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You, and not Microsoft, are responsible for all aspects of your engagement with a labeling company, including but not limited to issues relating to scope, quality, schedule, and pricing.
