Another notable difference between the time series models and the regression models is in the way they generate forecasts. Time series models are generally defined by recursion relations and produce forecasts one-at-a-time. To forecast many periods into the future, they iterate up-to the forecast horizon, feeding previous forecasts back into the model to generate the next one-period-ahead forecast as needed. In contrast, the regression models are so-called **direct forecasters** that generate _all_ forecasts up to the horizon in one go. Direct forecasters can be preferable to recursive ones because recursive models compound prediction error when they feed previous forecasts back into the model. When lag features are included, AutoML makes some important modifications to the training data so that the regression models can function as direct forecasters. See the [lag features article](./concept-automl-forecasting-lags.md) for more details. 

## Forecasting models in AutoML
The following table lists the forecasting models implemented in AutoML and what category they belong to:

Time Series Models | Regression Models
-------------------| -----------------
[Naive, Seasonal Naive, Average, Seasonal Average](https://otexts.com/fpp3/simple-methods.html), [ARIMA(X)](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html), [Exponential Smoothing](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing.html) | [Linear SGD](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#stochastic-gradient-descent-sgd), [LARS LASSO](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#lars-lasso), [Elastic Net](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#elastic-net), [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), [K Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors-regression), [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#regression), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests), [Extremely Randomized Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#extremely-randomized-trees), [Gradient Boosted Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#regression), [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html), [ForecastTCN](./how-to-auto-train-forecast.md#enable-deep-learning)

The models in each category are listed roughly in order of the complexity of patterns they're able to incorporate, also known as the **model capacity**. A Naive model, which simply forecasts the last observed value, has low capacity while the Temporal Convolutional Network (ForecastTCN), a deep neural network with potentially millions of tunable parameters, has high capacity.

Importantly, AutoML also includes **ensemble** models that create weighted combinations of the best performing models to further improve accuracy. For forecasting, we use a [soft voting ensemble](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#voting-regressor) where composition and weights are found via the [Caruana Ensemble Selection Algorithm](http://www.niculescu-mizil.org/papers/shotgun.icml04.revised.rev2.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> There are two important caveats for forecast model ensembles:
> 1.  The TCN cannot currently be included in ensembles.
> 2. AutoML by default disables another ensemble method, the **stack ensemble**, which is included with default regression and classification tasks in AutoML. The stack ensemble fits a meta-model on the best model forecasts to find ensemble weights. We've found in internal benchmarking that this strategy has an increased tendency to over fit time series data. This can result in poor generalization, so the stack ensemble is disabled by default. However, it can be enabled if desired in the AutoML configuration.

## How AutoML uses your data

AutoML accepts time series data in tabular, "wide" format; that is, each variable must have its own corresponding column. AutoML requires one of the columns to be the time axis for the forecasting problem. This column must be parsable into a datetime type. The simplest time series data set consists of a **time column** and a numeric **target column**. The target is the variable one intends to predict into the future. The following is an example of the format in this simple case:
