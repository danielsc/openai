#### Common error codes for kubernetes online endpoints

Below are common error codes when consuming Kubernetes online endpoints with REST requests:

| Status code | Reason phrase                                                                 | Why this code might get returned                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 409         | Conflict error                                                                | When an operation is already in progress, any new operation on that same online endpoint will respond with 409 conflict error. For example, If create or update online endpoint operation is in progress and if you trigger a new Delete operation it will throw an error.                                                                                                                             |
| 502         | Has thrown an exception or crashed in the `run()` method of the score.py file | When there's an error in `score.py`, for example an imported package does not exist in the conda environment, a syntax error, or a failure in the `init()` method. You can follow [here](#error-resourcenotready) to debug the file.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 503         | Receive large spikes in requests per second                                   | The autoscaler is designed to handle gradual changes in load. If you receive large spikes in requests per second, clients may receive an HTTP status code 503. Even though the autoscaler reacts quickly, it takes AKS a significant amount of time to create more containers. You can follow [here](#how-to-prevent-503-status-codes) to prevent 503 status codes.                                    |
| 504         | Request has timed out                                                         | A 504 status code indicates that the request has timed out. The default timeout setting is 5 seconds. You can increase the timeout or try to speed up the endpoint by modifying the score.py to remove unnecessary calls. If these actions don't correct the problem, you can follow [here](#error-resourcenotready) to debug the score.py file. The code may be in a non-responsive state or an infinite loop. |
| 500         | Internal server error                                                         | Azure ML-provisioned infrastructure is failing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |


### How to prevent 503 status codes
Kubernetes online deployments support autoscaling, which allows replicas to be added to support extra load, more information you can find in [AzureML inference router](how-to-kubernetes-inference-routing-azureml-fe.md). Decisions to scale up/down is based off of utilization of the current container replicas.

There are two things that can help prevent 503 status codes:
