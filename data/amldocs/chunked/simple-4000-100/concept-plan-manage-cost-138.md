Budgets can be created with filters for specific resources or services in Azure if you want more granularity present in your monitoring. Filters help ensure that you don't accidentally create new resources that cost you additional money. For more about the filter options when you when create a budget, see [Group and filter options](../cost-management-billing/costs/group-filter.md?WT.mc_id=costmanagementcontent_docsacmhorizontal_-inproduct-learn).

## Export cost data

You can also [export your cost data](../cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-export-acm-data.md?WT.mc_id=costmanagementcontent_docsacmhorizontal_-inproduct-learn) to a storage account. This is helpful when you need or others to do additional data analysis for costs. For example, a finance teams can analyze the data using Excel or Power BI. You can export your costs on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule and set a custom date range. Exporting cost data is the recommended way to retrieve cost datasets.

## Other ways to manage and reduce costs for Azure Machine Learning

Use the following tips to help you manage and optimize your compute resource costs.

- Configure your training clusters for autoscaling
- Set quotas on your subscription and workspaces
- Set termination policies on your training job
- Use low-priority virtual machines (VM)
- Schedule compute instances to shut down and start up automatically
- Use an Azure Reserved VM Instance
- Train locally
- Parallelize training
- Set data retention and deletion policies
- Deploy resources to the same region
- Delete instances and clusters if you do not plan on using them in the near future.
