> Any jobs that are running when a service outage occurs will not automatically transition to the secondary workspace. It is also unlikely that the jobs will resume and finish successfully in the primary workspace once the outage is resolved. Instead, these jobs must be resubmitted, either in the secondary workspace or in the primary (once the outage is resolved).

### Moving artifacts between workspaces

Depending on your recovery approach, you may need to copy artifacts such as dataset and model objects between the workspaces to continue your work. Currently, the portability of artifacts between workspaces is limited. We recommend managing artifacts as code where possible so that they can be recreated in the failover instance.

The following artifacts can be exported and imported between workspaces by using the [Azure CLI extension for machine learning](v1/reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md):

| Artifact | Export | Import |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Models | [az ml model download --model-id {ID} --target-dir {PATH}](/cli/azure/ml/model#az-ml-model-download) | [az ml model register â€“name {NAME} --path {PATH}](/cli/azure/ml/model) |
| Environments | [az ml environment download -n {NAME} -d {PATH}](/cli/azure/ml/environment#ml-az-ml-environment-download) | [az ml environment register -d {PATH}](/cli/azure/ml/environment#ml-az-ml-environment-register) |
| Azure ML pipelines (code-generated) | [az ml pipeline get --path {PATH}](/cli/azure/ml(v1)/pipeline#az-ml(v1)-pipeline-get) | [az ml pipeline create --name {NAME} -y {PATH}](/cli/azure/ml(v1)/pipeline#az-ml(v1)-pipeline-create)

> [!TIP]
> * __Registered datasets__ cannot be downloaded or moved. This includes datasets generated by Azure ML, such as intermediate pipeline datasets. However datasets that refer to a shared file location that both workspaces can access, or where the underlying data storage is replicated, can be registered on both workspaces. Use the [az ml dataset register](/cli/azure/ml(v1)/dataset#ml-az-ml-dataset-register) to register a dataset.
> * __Job outputs__ are stored in the default storage account associated with a workspace. While job outputs might become inaccessible from the studio UI in the case of a service outage, you can directly access the data through the storage account. For more information on working with data stored in blobs, see [Create, download, and list blobs with Azure CLI](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli.md).

## Recovery options

### Workspace deletion

If you accidentally deleted your workspace it is currently not possible to recover it. However you are able to retrieve your existing notebooks from the corresponding storage if you follow these steps:
* In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) navigate to the storage account that was linked to the deleted Azure Machine Learning workspace.
* In the Data storage section on the left, click on **File shares**.
* Your notebooks are located on the file share with the name that contains your workspace ID.
