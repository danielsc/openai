#### Inputs

When you use an input in the command, you need to specify the input name. To indicate an input variable, use the form `${{inputs.input_name}}`. For instance, `${{inputs.wiki}}`. You can then refer to it in the command, for instance, `--data ${{inputs.wiki}}`.

## Review and Create 

Once you've configured your job, choose **Next** to go to the **Review** page. To modify a setting, choose the pencil icon and make the change. 

You may choose **view the YAML spec** to review and download the yaml file generated by this job configuration. This job yaml file can be used to submit the job from the CLI (v2). (See [Train models (create jobs) with the CLI (v2)](how-to-train-cli.md).)
