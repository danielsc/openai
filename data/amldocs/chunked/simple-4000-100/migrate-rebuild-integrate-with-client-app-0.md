# Consume pipeline endpoints from client applications

[!INCLUDE [ML Studio (classic) retirement](../../includes/machine-learning-studio-classic-deprecation.md)]

In this article, you learn how to integrate client applications with Azure Machine Learning endpoints. 

This article is part of the ML Studio (classic) to Azure Machine Learning migration series. For more information on migrating to Azure Machine Learning, see [the migration overview article](migrate-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An Azure Machine Learning workspace. [Create workspace resources](quickstart-create-resources.md).
- An [Azure Machine Learning real-time endpoint or pipeline endpoint](migrate-rebuild-web-service.md).

## Consume a real-time endpoint

If you deployed your model as a *real-time endpoint*, you can find its REST endpoint, and pre-generated consumption code in C#, Python, and R:

1. Go to Azure Machine Learning studio ([ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com)).
1. Go the **Endpoints** tab.
1. Select your real-time endpoint.
1. Select **Consume**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also find the Swagger specification for your endpoint in the **Details** tab. Use the Swagger definition to understand your endpoint schema. For more information on Swagger definition, see [Swagger official documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/).

## Consume a pipeline endpoint

There are two ways to consume a pipeline endpoint:

- REST API calls
- Integration with Azure Data Factory

### Use REST API calls

Call the REST endpoint from your client application. You can use the Swagger specification for your endpoint to understand its schema:

1. Go to Azure Machine Learning studio ([ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com)).
1. Go the **Endpoints** tab.
1. Select **Pipeline endpoints**.
1. Select your pipeline endpoint.
1. In the **Pipeline endpoint overview** pane, select the link under **REST endpoint documentation**.

### Use Azure Data Factory

You can call your Azure Machine Learning pipeline as a step in an Azure Data Factory pipeline. For more information, see [Execute Azure Machine Learning pipelines in Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/transform-data-machine-learning-service.md).

## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to find schema and sample code for your pipeline endpoints. For more information on authenticating to an endpoint, see [Authenticate to an online endpoint](how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md).
