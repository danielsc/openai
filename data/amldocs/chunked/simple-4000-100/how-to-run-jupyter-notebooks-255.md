### Edit mode shortcuts

Edit mode is indicated by a text cursor prompting you to type in the editor area. When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell. Enter edit mode by pressing `Enter` or select a cell's editor area. The left border of the active cell is green and hatched, and its **Run** button is green. You also see the cursor prompt in the cell in Edit mode.

Using the following keystroke shortcuts, you can more easily navigate and run code in Azure Machine Learning notebooks when in Edit mode.
