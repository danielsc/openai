1. Select **Next**.
    
1. On the **[Optional] Validate and test** form, 
    1. Select k-fold cross-validation as your **Validation type**.
    1.  Select 5 as your **Number of cross validations**.

## Run experiment

To run your experiment, select **Finish**. The **Job details**  screen opens with the **Job status** at the top next to the job number. This status updates as the experiment progresses. Notifications also appear in the top right corner of the studio, to inform you of the status of your experiment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Preparation takes **10-15 minutes** to prepare the experiment job.
> Once running, it takes **2-3 minutes more for each iteration**.<br> <br>
> In production, you'd likely walk away for a bit as this process takes time. While you wait, we suggest you start exploring the tested algorithms on the **Models** tab as they complete. 

##  Explore models

Navigate to the **Models** tab to see the algorithms (models) tested. By default, the models are ordered by metric score as they complete. For this tutorial, the model that scores the highest based on the chosen **Normalized root mean squared error** metric is at the top of the list.

While you wait for all of the experiment models to finish, select the **Algorithm name** of a completed model to explore its performance details. 

The following example navigates through the **Details** and the **Metrics** tabs to view the selected model's properties, metrics and performance charts.

## Deploy the model

Automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning studio allows you to deploy the best model as a web service in a few steps. Deployment is the integration of the model so it can predict on new data and identify potential areas of opportunity. 

For this experiment, deployment to a web service means that the bike share company now has an iterative and scalable web solution for forecasting bike share rental demand. 

Once the job is complete, navigate back to parent job page by selecting **Job 1** at the top of your screen.

In the **Best model summary** section, the best model in the context of this experiment, is selected based on the **Normalized root mean squared error metric.** 

We deploy this model, but be advised, deployment takes about 20 minutes to complete. The deployment process entails several steps including registering the model, generating resources, and configuring them for the web service.

1. Select **the best model** to open the model-specific page.

1. Select the **Deploy** button located in the top-left area of the screen.

1. Populate the **Deploy a model** pane as follows:

    Field| Value
    ----|----
    Deployment name| bikeshare-deploy
    Deployment description| bike share demand deployment
    Compute type | Select Azure Compute Instance (ACI)
    Enable authentication| Disable. 
    Use custom deployment assets| Disable. Disabling allows for the default driver file (scoring script) and environment file to be autogenerated.
