# Calendar features for time series forecasting in AutoML

This article focuses on the calendar-based features that AutoML creates to increase the accuracy of forecasting regression models. Since holidays can have a strong influence on how the modeled system behaves, the time before, during, and after a holiday can bias the seriesâ€™ patterns. Each holiday generates a window over your existing dataset that the learner can assign an effect to. This can be especially useful in scenarios such as holidays that generate high demands for specific products. See the [methods overview article](./concept-automl-forecasting-methods.md) for more general information about forecasting methodology in AutoML. Instructions and examples for training forecasting models in AutoML can be found in our [set up AutoML for time series forecasting](./how-to-auto-train-forecast.md) article.

As a part of feature engineering, AutoML transforms datetime type columns provided in the training data into new columns of calendar-based features. These features can help regression models learn seasonal patterns at several cadences. AutoML can always create calendar features from the time index of the time series since this is a required column in the training data. Calendar features are also made from other columns with datetime type, if any are present. See the [how AutoML uses your data](./concept-automl-forecasting-methods.md#how-automl-uses-your-data) guide for more information on data requirements.

AutoML considers two categories of calendar features: standard features that are based entirely on date and time values and holiday features which are specific to a country or region of the world. We'll go over these features in the remainder of the article. 

## Standard calendar features

Th following table shows the full set of AutoML's standard calendar features along with an example output. The example uses the standard `YY-mm-dd %H-%m-%d` format for datetime representation. 

| Feature name | Description | Example output for 2011-01-01 00:25:30 |
| --- | ----------- | -------------- |
|`year`|Numeric feature representing the calendar year |2011|
|`year_iso`|Represents ISO year as defined in ISO 8601. ISO years start on the first week of year that has a Thursday. For example, if January 1 is a Friday, the ISO year begins on January 4. ISO years may differ from calendar years.|2010|
|`half`| Feature indicating whether the date is in the first or second half of the year. It is 1 if the date is prior to July 1 and 2 otherwise.
|`quarter`|Numeric feature representing the quarter of the given date.  It takes values 1, 2, 3, or 4 representing first, second, third, fourth quarter of calendar year.|1|
|`month`|Numeric feature representing the calendar month. It takes values 1 through 12.|1|
|`month_lbl`|String feature representing the name of month.|'January'|
|`day`|Numeric feature representing the day of the month. It takes values from 1 through 31.|1|
|`hour`|Numeric feature representing the hour of the day. It takes values 0 through 23.|0|
|`minute`|Numeric feature representing the minute within the hour. It takes values 0 through 59.|25|
|`second`|Numeric feature representing the second of the given datetime. In the case where only date format is provided, then it is assumed as 0. It takes values 0 through 59.|30|
|`am_pm`|Numeric feature indicating whether the time is in the morning or evening. It is 0 for times before 12PM and 1 for times after 12PM. |0|
|`am_pm_lbl`|String feature indicating whether the time is in the morning or evening.|'am'|
|`hour12`|Numeric feature representing the hour of the day on a 12 hour clock. It takes values 0 through 12 for first half of the day and 1 through 11 for second half.|0|
|`wday`|Numeric feature representing the day of the week.  It takes values 0 through 6, where 0 corresponds to Monday. |5|
|`wday_lbl`|String feature representing name of the day of the week. |
|`qday`|Numeric feature representing the day within the quarter. It takes values 1 through 92.|1|
