# What is Azure Machine Learning?

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.

You can create a model in Azure Machine Learning or use a model built from an open-source platform, such as Pytorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. MLOps tools help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.

> **Free trial!**  If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. [Try the free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/machine-learning/search/). You get credits to spend on Azure services. After they're used up, you can keep the account and use [free Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). Your credit card is never charged unless you explicitly change your settings and ask to be charged.

## Who is Azure Machine Learning for?

Azure Machine Learning is for individuals and teams implementing MLOps within their organization to bring machine learning models into production in a secure and auditable production environment.

Data scientists and ML engineers will find tools to accelerate and automate their day-to-day workflows. Application developers will find tools for integrating models into applications or services. Platform developers will find a robust set of tools, backed by durable Azure Resource Manager APIs, for building advanced ML tooling.

Enterprises working in the Microsoft Azure cloud will find familiar security and role-based access control (RBAC) for infrastructure. You can set up a project to deny access to protected data and select operations.

## Productivity for everyone on the team

Machine learning projects often require a team with varied skill set to build and maintain. Azure Machine Learning has tools that help enable you to: 

* Collaborate with your team via shared notebooks, compute resources, data, and environments

* Develop models for fairness and explainability, tracking and auditability to fulfill lineage and audit compliance requirements

* Deploy ML models quickly and easily at scale, and manage and govern them efficiently with MLOps

* Run machine learning workloads anywhere with built-in governance, security, and compliance

### Cross-compatible platform tools that meet your needs

Anyone on an ML team can use their preferred tools to get the job done. Whether you're running rapid experiments, hyperparameter-tuning, building pipelines, or managing inferences, you can use familiar interfaces including:

* [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com)
* [Python SDK (v2)](https://aka.ms/sdk-v2-install)
* [CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md))
* [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs ](/rest/api/azureml/)

As you're refining the model and collaborating with others throughout the rest of Machine Learning development cycle, you can share and find assets, resources, and metrics for your projects on the Azure Machine Learning studio UI.

### Studio

The [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) offers multiple authoring experiences depending on the type of project and the level of your past ML experience, without having to install anything.

* Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

* Visualize run metrics: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.

* Azure Machine Learning designer: use the designer to train and deploy machine learning models without writing any code. Drag and drop datasets and components to create ML pipelines. Try out the [designer tutorial](tutorial-designer-automobile-price-train-score.md).

* Automated machine learning UI: Learn how to create [automated ML experiments](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md) with an easy-to-use interface.
