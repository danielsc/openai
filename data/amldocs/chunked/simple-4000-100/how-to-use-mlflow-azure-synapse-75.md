Models can be registered in Azure Machine Learning workspace, which offers a centralized repository to manage their lifecycle. The following example logs a model trained with Spark MLLib and also registers it in the registry.

```python
mlflow.spark.log_model(model, 
                       artifact_path = "model", 
                       registered_model_name = "model_name")  
```

* **If a registered model with the name doesn’t exist**, the method registers a new model, creates version 1, and returns a ModelVersion MLflow object. 

* **If a registered model with the name already exists**, the method creates a new model version and returns the version object. 

You can manage models registered in Azure Machine Learning using MLflow. View [Manage models registries in Azure Machine Learning with MLflow](how-to-manage-models-mlflow.md) for more details.

## Deploying and consuming models registered in Azure Machine Learning

Models registered in Azure Machine Learning Service using MLflow can be consumed as: 

* An Azure Machine Learning endpoint (real-time and batch): This deployment allows you to leverage Azure Machine Learning deployment capabilities for both real-time and batch inference in Azure Container Instances (ACI), Azure Kubernetes (AKS) or our Managed Endpoints. 

* MLFlow model objects or Pandas UDFs, which can be used in Azure Synapse Analytics notebooks in streaming or batch pipelines.

### Deploy models to Azure Machine Learning endpoints 
You can leverage the `azureml-mlflow` plugin to deploy a model to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. Check [How to deploy MLflow models](how-to-deploy-mlflow-models.md) page for a complete detail about how to deploy models to the different targets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Models need to be registered in Azure Machine Learning registry in order to deploy them. Deployment of unregistered models is not supported in Azure Machine Learning.

### Deploy models for batch scoring using UDFs

You can choose Azure Synapse Analytics clusters for batch scoring. The MLFlow model is loaded and used as a Spark Pandas UDF to score new data. 

```python
from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, FloatType 

model_uri = "runs:/"+last_run_id+ {model_path} 

#Create a Spark UDF for the MLFlow model 
pyfunc_udf = mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf(spark, model_uri) 

#Load Scoring Data into Spark Dataframe 
scoreDf = spark.table({table_name}).where({required_conditions}) 

#Make Prediction 
preds = (scoreDf 
           .withColumn('target_column_name', pyfunc_udf('Input_column1', 'Input_column2', ' Input_column3', …)) 
        ) 

display(preds) 
```

## Clean up resources

If you wish to keep your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, but no longer need the Azure ML workspace, you can delete the Azure ML workspace. If you don't plan to use the logged metrics and artifacts in your workspace, the ability to delete them individually is unavailable at this time. Instead, delete the resource group that contains the storage account and workspace, so you don't incur any charges:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left.

   ![Delete in the Azure portal](./media/how-to-use-mlflow-azure-databricks/delete-resources.png)

1. From the list, select the resource group you created.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter the resource group name. Then select **Delete**.
