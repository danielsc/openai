__To use Azure RBAC__, follow the steps in the [Datastore: Azure Storage Account](how-to-enable-studio-virtual-network.md#datastore-azure-storage-account) section of the 'Use Azure Machine Learning studio in an Azure Virtual Network' article. Data Lake Storage Gen2 is based on Azure Storage, so the same steps apply when using Azure RBAC.

__To use ACLs__, the managed identity of the workspace can be assigned access just like any other security principal. For more information, see [Access control lists on files and directories](../storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control.md#access-control-lists-on-files-and-directories).
