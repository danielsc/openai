Data asset creation also creates a *reference* to the data source location, along with a copy of its metadata. Because the data remains in its existing location, you incur no extra storage cost, and you don't risk data source integrity. You can create Data assets from Azure ML datastores, Azure Storage, public URLs, or local files.
