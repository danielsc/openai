This folder contains the logs generated by Azure Machine Learning and it will be closed by default. The logs generated by the system are grouped into different folders, based on the stage of the job in the runtime.

#### Other folders

For jobs training on multi-compute clusters, logs are present for each node IP. The structure for each node is the same as single node jobs. There's one more logs folder for overall execution, stderr, and stdout logs.

Azure Machine Learning logs information from various sources during training, such as AutoML or the Docker container that runs the training job. Many of these logs aren't documented. If you encounter problems and contact Microsoft support, they may be able to use these logs during troubleshooting.

* [Train ML models with MLflow and Azure Machine Learning](how-to-train-mlflow-projects.md).
* [Migrate from SDK v1 logging to MLflow tracking](reference-migrate-sdk-v1-mlflow-tracking.md).
