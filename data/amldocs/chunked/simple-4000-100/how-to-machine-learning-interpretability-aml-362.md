You can deploy the explainer along with the original model and use it at inference time to provide the individual feature importance values (local explanation) for any new datapoint. We also offer lighter-weight scoring explainers to improve interpretability performance at inference time, which is currently supported only in Azure Machine Learning SDK. The process of deploying a lighter-weight scoring explainer is similar to deploying a model and includes the following steps:

1. Create an explanation object. For example, you can use `TabularExplainer`:

   ```python
    from interpret.ext.blackbox import TabularExplainer


   explainer = TabularExplainer(model, 
                                initialization_examples=x_train, 
                                features=dataset_feature_names, 
                                classes=dataset_classes, 
                                transformations=transformations)
   ```

1. Create a scoring explainer with the explanation object.

   ```python
   from azureml.interpret.scoring.scoring_explainer import KernelScoringExplainer, save

   # create a lightweight explainer at scoring time
   scoring_explainer = KernelScoringExplainer(explainer)

   # pickle scoring explainer
   # pickle scoring explainer locally
   OUTPUT_DIR = 'my_directory'
   save(scoring_explainer, directory=OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)
   ```

1. Configure and register an image that uses the scoring explainer model.

   ```python
   # register explainer model using the path from ScoringExplainer.save - could be done on remote compute
   # scoring_explainer.pkl is the filename on disk, while my_scoring_explainer.pkl will be the filename in cloud storage
   run.upload_file('my_scoring_explainer.pkl', os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'scoring_explainer.pkl'))
   
   scoring_explainer_model = run.register_model(model_name='my_scoring_explainer', 
                                                model_path='my_scoring_explainer.pkl')
   print(scoring_explainer_model.name, scoring_explainer_model.id, scoring_explainer_model.version, sep = '\t')
   ```

1. As an optional step, you can retrieve the scoring explainer from cloud and test the explanations.

   ```python
   from azureml.interpret.scoring.scoring_explainer import load

   # retrieve the scoring explainer model from cloud"
   scoring_explainer_model = Model(ws, 'my_scoring_explainer')
   scoring_explainer_model_path = scoring_explainer_model.download(target_dir=os.getcwd(), exist_ok=True)

   # load scoring explainer from disk
   scoring_explainer = load(scoring_explainer_model_path)

   # test scoring explainer locally
   preds = scoring_explainer.explain(x_test)
   print(preds)
   ```

1. Deploy the image to a compute target, by following these steps:

   1. If needed, register your original prediction model by following the steps in [Deploy models with Azure Machine Learning](./how-to-deploy-online-endpoints.md).

   1. Create a scoring file.

         ```python
         %%writefile score.py
         import json
         import numpy as np
         import pandas as pd
         import os
         import pickle
         from sklearn.externals import joblib
         from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
         from azureml.core.model import Model
          
         def init():
         
            global original_model
            global scoring_model
             
            # retrieve the path to the model file using the model name
            # assume original model is named original_prediction_model
            original_model_path = Model.get_model_path('original_prediction_model')
            scoring_explainer_path = Model.get_model_path('my_scoring_explainer')

            original_model = joblib.load(original_model_path)
            scoring_explainer = joblib.load(scoring_explainer_path)

         def run(raw_data):
            # get predictions and explanations for each data point
            data = pd.read_json(raw_data)
            # make prediction
            predictions = original_model.predict(data)
            # retrieve model explanations
            local_importance_values = scoring_explainer.explain(data)
            # you can return any data type as long as it is JSON-serializable
            return {'predictions': predictions.tolist(), 'local_importance_values': local_importance_values}
         ```
