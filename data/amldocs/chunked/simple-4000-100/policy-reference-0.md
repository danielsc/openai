# Azure Policy built-in policy definitions for Azure Machine Learning

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions for Azure Machine Learning. Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing
governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management. Policy
definitions for these common use cases are already available in your Azure environment as built-ins
to help you get started. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, see
[Azure Policy built-in definitions](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
the link in the **GitHub** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).
