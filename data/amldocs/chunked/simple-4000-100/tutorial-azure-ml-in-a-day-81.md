The result is a handler to the workspace that you'll use to manage other resources and jobs.

> Creating MLClient will not connect to the workspace. The client initialization is lazy, it will wait for the first time it needs to make a call (in the notebook below, that will happen during compute creation).

## Create a compute resource to run your job

You'll need a compute resource for running a job. It can be single or multi-node machines with Linux or Windows OS, or a specific compute fabric like Spark.

You'll provision a Linux compute cluster. See the [full list on VM sizes and prices](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/machine-learning/) .

For this example, you only need a basic cluster, so you'll use a Standard_DS3_v2 model with 2 vCPU cores, 7-GB RAM and create an Azure ML Compute.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

# Name assigned to the compute cluster
cpu_compute_target = "cpu-cluster"

try:
    # let's see if the compute target already exists
    cpu_cluster = ml_client.compute.get(cpu_compute_target)
    print(
        f"You already have a cluster named {cpu_compute_target}, we'll reuse it as is."
    )

except Exception:
    print("Creating a new cpu compute target...")

    # Let's create the Azure ML compute object with the intended parameters
    cpu_cluster = AmlCompute(
        name=cpu_compute_target,
        # Azure ML Compute is the on-demand VM service
        type="amlcompute",
        # VM Family
        size="STANDARD_DS3_V2",
        # Minimum running nodes when there is no job running
        min_instances=0,
        # Nodes in cluster
        max_instances=4,
        # How many seconds will the node running after the job termination
        idle_time_before_scale_down=180,
        # Dedicated or LowPriority. The latter is cheaper but there is a chance of job termination
        tier="Dedicated",
    )
    print(
        f"AMLCompute with name {cpu_cluster.name} will be created, with compute size {cpu_cluster.size}"
    )
    # Now, we pass the object to MLClient's create_or_update method
    cpu_cluster = ml_client.compute.begin_create_or_update(cpu_cluster)
```

## Create a job environment

To run your AzureML job on your compute resource, you'll need an [environment](concept-environments.md). An environment lists the software runtime and libraries that you want installed on the compute where you’ll be training. It's similar to your Python environment on your local machine.

AzureML provides many curated or ready-made environments, which are useful for common training and inference scenarios. You can also create your own custom environments using a docker image, or a conda configuration.

In this example, you'll create a custom conda environment for your jobs, using a conda yaml file.

First, create a directory to store the file in.

```python
import os

dependencies_dir = "./dependencies"
os.makedirs(dependencies_dir, exist_ok=True)
```

Now, create the file in the dependencies directory. The cell below uses IPython magic to write the file into the directory you just created.

```python
%%writefile {dependencies_dir}/conda.yml
name: model-env
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - numpy=1.21.2
  - pip=21.2.4
  - scikit-learn=0.24.2
  - scipy=1.7.1
  - pandas>=1.1,<1.2
  - pip:
    - inference-schema[numpy-support]==1.3.0
    - xlrd==2.0.1
    - mlflow== 1.26.1
    - azureml-mlflow==1.42.0
    - psutil>=5.8,<5.9
    - tqdm>=4.59,<4.60
    - ipykernel~=6.0
    - matplotlib
```

The specification contains some usual packages, that you'll use in your job (numpy, pip).

Reference this *yaml* file to create and register this custom environment in your workspace:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

custom_env_name = "aml-scikit-learn"

pipeline_job_env = Environment(
    name=custom_env_name,
    description="Custom environment for Credit Card Defaults pipeline",
    tags={"scikit-learn": "0.24.2"},
    conda_file=os.path.join(dependencies_dir, "conda.yml"),
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04:latest",
)
pipeline_job_env = ml_client.environments.create_or_update(pipeline_job_env)

print(
    f"Environment with name {pipeline_job_env.name} is registered to workspace, the environment version is {pipeline_job_env.version}"
)
```
