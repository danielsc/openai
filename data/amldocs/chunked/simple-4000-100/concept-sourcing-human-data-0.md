# What is "human data" and why is it important to source responsibly?

Human data is data collected directly from, or about, people. Human data may include personal data such as names, age, images, or voice clips and sensitive data such as genetic data, biometric data, gender identity, religious beliefs, or political affiliations. 

Collecting this data can be important to building AI systems that work for all users. But certain practices should be avoided, especially ones that can cause physical and psychological harm to data contributors.

The best practices in this article will help you conduct manual data collection projects from volunteers where everyone involved is treated with respect, and potential harms—especially those faced by vulnerable groups—are anticipated and mitigated. This means that:

- People contributing data are not coerced or exploited in any way, and they have control over what personal data is collected.
- People collecting and labeling data have adequate training. 

These practices can also help ensure more-balanced and higher-quality datasets and better stewardship of human data.

These are emerging practices, and we are continually learning. The best practices below are a starting point as you begin your own responsible human data collections. These best practices are provided for informational purposes only and should not be treated as legal advice. All human data collections should undergo specific privacy and legal reviews.

## General best practices

We suggest the following best practices for manually collecting human data directly from people.

        - Participants should understand and consent to data collection and how their data will be used.
        - Data should only be stored, processed, and used for purposes that are part of the original documented informed consent.
        - Consent documentation should be properly stored and associated with the collected data.

    :::column span="":::
        - Data contributors should not be pressured or coerced into data collections and should be fairly compensated for their time and data.
        - Inappropriate compensation can be exploitative or coercive.

    :::column-end:::

    :::column span="":::
        - Demographic information that is not self-reported by data contributors but assigned by data collectors may 1) result in inaccurate metadata and 2) be disrespectful to data contributors.
