| `name`                              | The name of the deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `model`                             | In this example, we specify the model properties inline: `path`. Model files are automatically uploaded and registered with an autogenerated name. For related best practices, see the tip in the next section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `code_configuration.code.path`      | The directory on the local development environment that contains all the Python source code for scoring the model. You can use nested directories and packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `code_configuration.scoring_script` | The Python file that's in the `code_configuration.code.path` scoring directory on the local development environment. This Python code must have an `init()` function and a `run()` function. The function `init()` will be called after the model is created or updated (you can use it to cache the model in memory, for example). The `run()` function is called at every invocation of the endpoint to do the actual scoring and prediction. |
| `environment`                       | Contains the details of the environment to host the model and code. In this example, we have inline definitions that include the`path`. We'll use `environment.docker.image` for the image. The `conda_file` dependencies will be installed on top of the image. For more information, see the tip in the next section.                                                                                                                         |
| `instance_type`                     | The VM SKU that will host your deployment instances. For more information, see [Managed online endpoints supported VM SKUs](reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `instance_count`                    | The number of instances in the deployment. Base the value on the workload you expect. For high availability, we recommend that you set `instance_count` to at least `3`. We reserve an extra 20% for performing upgrades. For more information, see [managed online endpoint quotas](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints).                                                                                  |

During deployment, the local files such as the Python source for the scoring model, are uploaded from the development environment.
