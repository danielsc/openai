## Requirements for a data science scenario

Once you know what you want to do with your data, you need to determine additional requirements for your solution. 

Make choices and possibly trade-offs for the following requirements:

- Accuracy
- Training time
- Linearity
- Number of parameters
- Number of features

## Accuracy

Accuracy in machine learning measures the effectiveness of a model as the proportion of true results to total cases. In Machine Learning designer, the [Evaluate Model component](./algorithm-module-reference/evaluate-model.md?WT.mc_id=docs-article-lazzeri) computes a set of industry-standard evaluation metrics. You can use this component to measure the accuracy of a trained model.

Getting the most accurate answer possible isnâ€™t always necessary. Sometimes an approximation is adequate, depending on what you want to use it for. If that is the case, you may be able to cut your processing time dramatically by sticking with more approximate methods. Approximate methods also naturally tend to avoid overfitting.
