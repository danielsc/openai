    "reply": "In Azure Machine Learning, a pipeline is a way to stitch together all the steps in your machine learning process, from data preparation to feature extraction to hyperparameter tuning to model evaluation. A pipeline could be reused to define repeatable and reusable steps for your data preparation, training, and scoring processes. It enables you to make your machine learning code reproducible, shareable and scalable.",
