    "reply": "You can use the following Azure CLI command to view the quotas for your Machine Learning workspace:\n```\naz ml workspace compute show-quota --name <name> --resource-group <resource-group> [--compute-target <compute-target>] [--ids]\n```\n\nReplace `<name>` with the name of the Machine Learning workspace and `<resource-group>` with the resource group that contains the workspace. You can also add `--compute-target` and `--ids` options if you have specific requirements for viewing compute targets or identity information.",
