How can I run a command job that uses train.py as entry script in AzureML SDK V2 ?

# Response A

To run a command job that uses train.py as entry script in AzureML SDK V2, you can use the `command()` function. First, create an environment object that specifies the environment for the job. Then, create a command job object that specifies the code, command, environment, and compute target for the job. Finally, submit the job using the `create_or_update()` method of the `jobs` object. Here's an example:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient, command
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Connect to the workspace
ml_client = MLClient.from_config(DefaultAzureCredential())

# Set up the environment
env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04",
    conda_file="pytorch-env.yml",
    name="pytorch-env"
)

# Define the command job
command_job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="train.py",
    environment=env,
    compute="cpu-cluster",
)

# Submit the job
returned_job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(command_job)
```

# Response B

You can use the `command()` function to run a command job that uses `train.py` as the entry script in AzureML SDK V2. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient, command
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Connect to the workspace
ml_client = MLClient.from_config(DefaultAzureCredential())

# Set up the environment
env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04",
    conda_file="pytorch-env.yml",
    name="pytorch-env"
)

# Define the command
command_job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py",
    environment=env,
    compute="cpu-cluster",
)

# Submit the job
returned_job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(command_job)
```

In this example, we're using the `command()` function to define a command job that runs the `train.py` script using the `python` command. We're also specifying the environment to use (`pytorch-env`) and the compute target (`cpu-cluster`). Finally, we're submitting the job using the `create_or_update()` method of the `jobs` object returned by `MLClient.from_config()`.
