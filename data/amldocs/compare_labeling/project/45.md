How to assign managed identity to an a workspace in AzureML ?

# Response A

You can assign a system- or user-assigned managed identity to a compute instance in AzureML to authenticate against other Azure resources such as storage. You can create a compute instance with managed identity from Azure ML Studio or use V2 CLI with a yaml file. Once the managed identity is created, grant the managed identity at least Storage Blob Data Reader role on the storage account of the datastore. Then, when you work on the compute instance, the managed identity is used automatically to authenticate against datastores.

# Response B

You can assign a system- or user-assigned managed identity to a compute instance in AzureML, to authenticate against other Azure resources such as storage. To assign a system-assigned managed identity to a compute instance, you can use the V2 CLI command `az ml compute create`. To assign a user-assigned managed identity, you can create a YAML file with the identity definition and use the V2 CLI command `az ml compute create --file compute.yaml`. Once the managed identity is created, grant the managed identity at least Storage Blob Data Reader role on the storage account of the datastore.
