# Question

can you give me an example of a yaml file to train a model with the CLI v2?

# Response A

Here is an example of a YAML file to train a model with the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2:

```yaml
name: my_training_job
environment: my_environment
entry_script: my_training_script.py
compute:
  target: my_compute
  node_count: 2
  process_count_per_node: 1
inputs:
  training_data: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_training_data
  validation_data: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_validation_data
outputs:
  model: $AZUREML_MODEL_DIR/model.pkl
```

This YAML file defines a training job named `my_training_job` that uses an environment named `my_environment` and a script named `my_training_script.py`. The job runs on a compute target named `my_compute` with two nodes and one process per node. The job takes two inputs, `training_data` and `validation_data`, and produces an output named `model`.

# Response B

Sure! Here's an example YAML file that trains a model using the CLI v2:

```yaml
name: my-training-job
environment: my-environment
entry_script: train.py
compute:
  target: my-compute
  node_count: 2
  process_count_per_node: 1
inputs:
  training_data: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_training_data
  validation_data: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_validation_data
outputs:
  model: $AZUREML_MODEL_DIR/model.pkl
```

This YAML file defines a training job named `my-training-job` that uses the `my-environment` environment to run the `train.py` script on the `my-compute` compute target. The script takes two inputs, `training_data` and `validation_data`, which are data references to the training and validation data. The script outputs a trained model, which is saved to `$AZUREML_MODEL_DIR/model.pkl`. 

You can run this training job using the following command:

```
az ml job create --file my_training_job.yaml
```

This will create a new training job in your Azure Machine Learning workspace using the configuration defined in the YAML file.
