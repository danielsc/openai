# Question

How can I tune the hyperparameters of a training job?

# Response A

You can tune the hyperparameters of a training job by sweeping the hyperparameters to find the optimal settings for your model. This feature applies the hyperparameter tuning capabilities in Azure Machine Learning. You can sweep hyperparameters by defining a search space in the configuration file and submitting the job. The search space is a dictionary of the hyperparameter search space. The key is the name of the hyperparameter and the value is the parameter expression. You can also use the Azure Machine Learning studio to visualize all of your hyperparameter tuning jobs.

# Response B

You can tune the hyperparameters of a training job by using Azure Machine Learning's hyperparameter tuning capabilities. You can either use automatic hyperparameter tuning or manually sweep hyperparameters to find the optimal settings for your model. To learn more about how to tune hyperparameters, see the [Azure Machine Learning documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters).
