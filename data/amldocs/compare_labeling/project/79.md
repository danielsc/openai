# Question

How can I get a list of running compute instances and how long they have been running with the v2 CLI?

# Response A

You can use the `az ml computetarget list` command to get a list of running compute instances. To see how long they have been running, you can add the `--query` parameter with the `creationTime` and `status` properties. The following command will return a list of running compute instances and their creation time and status:

```
az ml computetarget list --query "[?provisioningState=='Succeeded'].{Name:name, CreationTime:creationTime, Status:status}"
```

# Response B

You can use the following command to get a list of running compute instances and how long they have been running with the v2 CLI:

```
az ml computetarget list --query "[?provisioningState=='Succeeded' && computeType=='ComputeInstance' && vmSize!=null].{Name:name, Status:properties.status, Location:location, VMSize:vmSize, RunningTime:now()-properties.createdTime}" -o table
```

This will return a table with the name, status, location, VM size, and running time of each running compute instance.
