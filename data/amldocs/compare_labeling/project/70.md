# Question

How can I use components with pipelines using the new CLI v2? Please provide a concrete example.

# Response A

To use components with pipelines using the new CLI v2, you can create a pipeline YAML file that defines the machine learning pipeline and a component YAML file that defines the component. The component YAML file should include metadata, interface, command, code, and environment. You can then use the Azure CLI to register the component and create a pipeline. For a concrete example, you can navigate to the `3b_pipeline_with_data` subdirectory of the `cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics` directory in the `azureml-examples` repository and follow the instructions provided in the README file.

# Response B

To use components with pipelines using the new CLI v2, you can define your pipeline in a YAML file and use the `az ml component create` command to create and register your components. Once your components are registered, you can reference them in your pipeline YAML file. Here's an example:

1. Clone the examples repository:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --depth 1
    cd azureml-examples/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics
    ```

2. Register the components to AzureML workspace using following commands:

    ```CLI
    az ml component create --file train.yml
    az ml component create --file score.yml
    az ml component create --file eval.yml
    ```

3. Define your pipeline in a YAML file, for example `pipeline.yml`:

    ```yaml
    name: my-pipeline
    description: My first pipeline with components
    pipeline:
      - name: train
        component: train
        inputs:
          data: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_train_data
          model: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_model
        outputs:
          model: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_model
      - name: score
        component: score
        inputs:
          data: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_test_data
          model: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_model
        outputs:
          score: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_score
      - name: eval
        component: eval
        inputs:
          score: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_score
          label: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_test_label
        outputs:
          accuracy: $AZUREML_DATAREFERENCE_accuracy
    ```

4. Run your pipeline using the `az ml run submit-pipeline` command:

    ```CLI
    az ml run submit-pipeline --file pipeline.yml
    ```

This example defines a pipeline with three components: `train`, `score`, and `eval`. The `train` component takes in training data and a model, and outputs a trained model. The `score` component takes in test data and a model, and outputs a score. The `eval` component takes in a score and a label, and outputs an accuracy. The pipeline YAML file references the registered components by name, and specifies the inputs and outputs for each component.
