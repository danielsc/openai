# Question

how can I see which jobs are running on a compute cluster?

# Response A

You can see which jobs are running on a compute cluster by using the Azure Machine Learning studio. In the studio, navigate to the compute cluster you want to check and click on the "Jobs" tab. This will show you a list of all the jobs that are currently running on that cluster. You can also see the status of each job, the time it started, and the duration of the job so far.

# Response B

You can see which jobs are running on a compute cluster by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK or the Azure portal. 

To use the Azure Machine Learning SDK, you can run the following code:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, ComputeTarget
from azureml.core.compute import AmlCompute

# Replace with your workspace details
workspace_name = "myworkspace"
resource_group = "myresourcegroup"
subscription_id = "12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef"

# Replace with your compute target name
compute_name = "mycompute"

# Get the workspace
ws = Workspace.get(name=workspace_name, subscription_id=subscription_id, resource_group=resource_group)

# Get the compute target
compute_target = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name=compute_name)

# Get the list of nodes in the compute target
nodes = AmlCompute(workspace=ws, name=compute_name).list_nodes()

# Print the list of nodes and their status
for node in nodes:
    print(node.get_status().serialize())
```

To use the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
2. Click on the "Compute" tab.
3. Click on the compute cluster you want to check.
4. Click on the "Nodes" tab.
5. You will see a list of nodes and their status.
