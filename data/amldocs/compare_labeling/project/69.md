# Question

How can I tune the hyperparameters of a training job using the v2 CLI?

# Response A

You can tune the hyperparameters of a training job using the v2 CLI by defining a search space for the hyperparameters and specifying the sweep procedure via sampling algorithm early termination. You can define the search space with customized settings and configure the sweep procedure via sampling algorithm early termination. You can also specify the experiment budget for your AutoML NLP training job using the `timeout_minutes` parameter in the `limits`. Finally, you can automatically end poorly performing runs with an early termination policy.

# Response B

You can tune the hyperparameters of a training job using the v2 CLI by defining a search space for the hyperparameters and specifying the sweep settings. Here's an example command:

```
az ml job create --file train.yaml --set search_space.model_name.values="[yolov5]" search_space.learning_rate.min_value=0.0001 search_space.learning_rate.max_value=0.01 search_space.model_size.values="[small, medium]" --set sweep.sampling_algorithm=random sweep.limits.max_total_trials=10 sweep.limits.max_concurrent_trials=2 sweep.early_termination.type=bandit sweep.early_termination.evaluation_interval=2 sweep.early_termination.slack_factor=0.2 sweep.early_termination.delay_evaluation=6
```

This command creates a training job using the `train.yaml` file and specifies the search space for the hyperparameters (`model_name`, `learning_rate`, and `model_size`). It also sets the sweep settings (`sampling_algorithm`, `max_total_trials`, `max_concurrent_trials`, and `early_termination`).
