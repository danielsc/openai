How to enable public access to a private link workspace using AzureML SDK V2?

# Response A

To enable public access to a private link workspace using AzureML SDK V2, you need to configure the workspace to allow public access. You can do this by setting the `public_network_access` flag to `enabled` when creating the workspace. If you have already created the workspace, you can update the workspace configuration to allow public access by using the `az ml workspace update` command with the `--public-network-access` flag set to `enabled`. Note that enabling public access to a private link workspace is only recommended if you plan on using managed online endpoint deployments that use public outbound.

# Response B

To enable public access to a private link workspace using AzureML SDK V2, you can follow these steps:

1. Get the workspace object using the `Workspace.get()` method.
2. Use the `update()` method of the workspace object to update the `public_network_access` property to `Enabled`.
3. Save the changes using the `save()` method of the workspace object.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace

# Get the workspace object
ws = Workspace.get(name='myworkspace', subscription_id='12345678-1234-5678-abcd-12345678abcd', resource_group='myresourcegroup')

# Enable public network access
ws.update(public_network_access='Enabled')

# Save the changes
ws.save()
```

Make sure to replace the values for `name`, `subscription_id`, and `resource_group` with the appropriate values for your workspace.
