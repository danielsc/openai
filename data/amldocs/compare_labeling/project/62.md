# Question

How can I start an AutoML job from the v2 CLI?

# Response A

To start an AutoML job from the v2 CLI, you can use the `az ml job create` command with the `--file` parameter to specify the YAML configuration file for the job. The YAML file should include the necessary information such as the task type, training and validation data, compute target, and training parameters. For NLP text NER jobs, the YAML file should follow the schema defined in the Azure Machine Learning documentation.

# Response B

To start an AutoML job from the v2 CLI, you can use the `az ml job create` command with the `--file` parameter to specify the YAML configuration file for the job. In the YAML file, you will need to specify the `type` as `automl` and the `task` as `text_ner` for named entity recognition. You will also need to provide the `training_data` and `validation_data` in CoNLL format. For more information on the YAML schema and how to configure the AutoML job, see the [Azure CLI (v2) Automated ML text NER job YAML schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-auto-train#cli-v2-automated-ml-text-ner-job-yaml-schema) documentation.
