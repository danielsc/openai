# Question

can you give me an example of a CLI v2 command to register a model?

# Response A

Sure! Here's an example of a CLI v2 command to register a model:

```
az ml model create --name <model_name> --type "custom_model" --path <model_path>
```

Replace `<model_name>` with the name you want to give your model, and `<model_path>` with the path to the directory containing your model files.

# Response B

Sure! Here's an example of a CLI v2 command to register a model:

```

Replace `<model_name>` with the name you want to give your model, and `<model_path>` with the path to the directory containing your model files. 

Note that this assumes you have already authenticated and set your default workspace using the `az ml workspace set` command.
