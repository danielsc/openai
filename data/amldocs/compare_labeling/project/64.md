# Question

how can I view the logs of a deployment using the v2 cli?

# Response A

You can use the Azure CLI v2 to view the logs of a deployment. First, use the command `az ml endpoint deployment list` to get the deployment ID. Then, use the command `az ml endpoint logs -i <deployment_id>` to view the logs. You can also use the `--since` and `--tail` parameters to specify the time range and number of lines to display, respectively.

# Response B

You can use the `az ml endpoint logs` command to view the logs of a deployment in Azure Machine Learning using the v2 CLI. For example, to view the logs of a deployment named `mydeployment` in an endpoint named `myendpoint`, you can run the following command:

```
az ml endpoint logs -n myendpoint -d mydeployment
```

This will display the logs for the deployment in the console. You can also use the `--output` parameter to save the logs to a file in JSON or text format. For more information on the `az ml endpoint logs` command, you can run `az ml endpoint logs -h`.
