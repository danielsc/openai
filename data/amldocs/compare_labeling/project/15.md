How can I  to create a GPU based compute instance using AzureML SDK V2

# Response A

To create a GPU based compute instance using AzureML SDK V2, you can use the following Python code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute
compute_name = "gpu-cluster"
cluster_basic = AmlCompute(
    name=compute_name,
    type="amlcompute",
    size="Standard_NC24s_v3",
    min_instances=0,
    max_instances=4,
    idle_time_before_scale_down=120,
)
ml_client.begin_create_or_update(cluster_basic)
```

This code creates a GPU compute of size `Standard_NC24s_v3` with four nodes. You can adjust the `min_instances`, `max_instances`, and `idle_time_before_scale_down` parameters as needed.

# Response B

You can create a GPU based compute instance using AzureML SDK V2 by following these steps:

1. Import the necessary packages:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
```

2. Define the compute configuration:

```python
compute_name = "gpu-cluster"
cluster_basic = AmlCompute(
    name=compute_name,
    type="amlcompute",
    size="Standard_NC24s_v3",
    min_instances=0,
    max_instances=4,
    idle_time_before_scale_down=120,
)
```

3. Create the compute:

```python
ml_client = MLClient(credential=credential)
ml_client.compute.create_or_update(cluster_basic)
```

This will create a GPU based compute instance with the name "gpu-cluster" and the size "Standard_NC24s_v3" with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 4 instances. The compute will scale down after 120 seconds of idle time.
