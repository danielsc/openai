# Question

how can I upload data to the cloud for use in a pipeline with the CLI v2?

# Response A

You can upload data to the cloud for use in a pipeline with the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2 by registering a dataset to Azure Machine Learning from a cloud service. You can also use the Import Data module in the designer to ingest data from a cloud service. Once you have registered a dataset in Azure Machine Learning, you can use it in your pipeline by dragging it onto the canvas. You can also write data to your cloud-based storage with outputs in your job.

# Response B

You can upload data to the cloud for use in a pipeline with the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2 extension. First, create a datastore that links the cloud storage service to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. Then, use the `az ml datastore upload` command to upload your data to the datastore. Finally, reference the data in your pipeline YAML file using the `azureml://` URI format. Here's an example command to upload a local file to a datastore:

```
az ml datastore upload --name <datastore-name> --src-path <local-file-path> --target-path <datastore-path>
```

And here's an example of how to reference the uploaded data in your pipeline YAML file:

```yaml
inputs:
  my_data:
    type: uri_file
    path: azureml://<datastore-name>/<datastore-path>/<file-name>
```

Replace `<datastore-name>`, `<datastore-path>`, and `<file-name>` with the appropriate values for your data.
