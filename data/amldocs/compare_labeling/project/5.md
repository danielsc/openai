# Question

How can I see progress of an online endpoint deploying in AzureML using CLI V2 ?

# Response A

You can use the `az ml endpoint deployment show` command to see the status of an online endpoint deployment in AzureML using CLI V2. This command shows the status of the deployment, including the endpoint name, deployment name, status, and other details. You can also use the `--watch` flag to continuously monitor the deployment status until it is complete.

# Response B

You can use the following command to see the status of your online endpoint deployment in AzureML using CLI V2:

```
az ml endpoint show-deployment-status --endpoint-name <endpoint-name> --query 'status'
```

Replace `<endpoint-name>` with the name of your endpoint. This command will return the current status of your endpoint deployment. Possible values for the status are `Creating`, `Updating`, `Deleting`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, and `Unknown`.
