How to use uri_folder data type inside a command Job in AzureML SDK V2?

# Response A

To use uri_folder data type inside a command Job in AzureML SDK V2, you need to create a job specification YAML file and specify the `type` and `path` parameters in the `inputs` section of the job. The `path` parameter can point to any of the supported paths, including a path on your local computer, a path on a public http(s) server, a path on Azure Storage, a path on a Datastore, or a path to a Data Asset. Then, you can use the `Input` class to define the `type` and `mode` of the data input.

# Response B

To use `uri_folder` data type inside a command Job in AzureML SDK V2, you can define the input in the job specification YAML file as follows:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/commandJob.schema.json

command: |
  ls ${{inputs.my_data}}
code: <folder where code is located>
inputs:
  my_data:
    type: uri_folder
    path: <path>
environment: azureml:AzureML-sklearn-1.0-ubuntu20.04-py38-cpu@latest
compute: azureml:cpu-cluster
```

In the `inputs` section of the job, specify the `type` as `uri_folder` and the `path` of your data location. You can use any of the paths outlined in the [Supported Paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-read-write-data-v2#supported-paths) section.
