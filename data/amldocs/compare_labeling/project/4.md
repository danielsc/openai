# Question

generate a python code samples to debug a failed job using Vscode and AZureML SDK V2?

# Response A

To debug a failed job using VS Code and AzureML SDK V2, you can use the `parallel_run_function` method to process tabular data. You can set the `logging_level` to "DEBUG" and the `mini_batch_error_threshold` to 5. You can also set the `retry_settings` to a maximum of 2 retries and a timeout of 60 seconds. Additionally, you can set the `task_overhead_timeout` to 1200 seconds, the `progress_update_timeout` to 600 seconds, and the `first_task_creation_timeout` to 600 seconds. Finally, you can set the `copy_logs_to_parent` to True and the `resource_monitor_interval` to 20 seconds.

# Response B

To debug a failed job using VS Code and AzureML SDK V2, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Azure Machine Learning extension for VS Code.
2. Set up your Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute target.
3. Create a script to submit a job to the compute target.
4. Run the script and wait for the job to fail.
5. Open the failed job in the Azure Machine Learning extension.
6. Click the "Debug" button to launch the job in debug mode.
7. Set breakpoints in your code and step through the execution to identify the issue.

Here's an example script that submits a job to a compute target:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Experiment, ScriptRunConfig
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute
from azureml.core.runconfig import RunConfiguration
from azureml.core.conda_dependencies import CondaDependencies

# Set up your workspace and compute target
ws = Workspace.from_config()
compute_target = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name="mycompute")

# Create a run configuration with the necessary dependencies
run_config = RunConfiguration()
run_config.environment.python.user_managed_dependencies = False
run_config.environment.python.conda_dependencies = CondaDependencies.create(
    conda_packages=["numpy", "pandas"],
    pip_packages=["azureml-sdk", "scikit-learn"],
    pin_sdk_version=False,
)

# Create a ScriptRunConfig with your script and run configuration
src = ScriptRunConfig(
    source_directory=".",
    script="train.py",
    compute_target=compute_target,
    run_config=run_config,
)

# Submit the job to the compute target
experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name="myexperiment")
run = experiment.submit(src)
run.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

Once the job fails, you can open it in the Azure Machine Learning extension by navigating to the "Experiments" tab and selecting the experiment that contains the failed job. From there, you can click on the failed job and then click the "Debug" button to launch the job in debug mode.
