# Question

How can I get a Containerized Jupyter Notebook to run as code in a pipeline using the v2 CLI?

# Response A

The tutorial "Create production ML pipelines with Python SDK v2 in a Jupyter notebook" explains how to use Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to create a production-ready machine learning (ML) project, using AzureML Python SDK v2. You'll learn how to use the AzureML Python SDK v2 to create, validate and run Azure ML pipelines. The tutorial includes how to create reusable Azure ML components, deploy the newly-trained model as an endpoint, and call the Azure ML endpoint for inferencing. The tutorial also includes how to connect to your Azure ML workspace, create Azure ML data assets, and create a cloud-based compute cluster to use for training your model.

# Response B

This article explains how to deploy an MLflow model to a batch endpoint to perform batch predictions using the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2. It does not cover containerizing a Jupyter Notebook to run as code in a pipeline. However, you can refer to the [Azure Machine Learning documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-run-notebook) for information on how to deploy and run a Jupyter Notebook as a web service or in a pipeline using the Azure Machine Learning SDK.
