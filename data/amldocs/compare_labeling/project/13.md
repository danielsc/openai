# Question

Generate a python code sample to enable debugging of a ManagedOnlineEndpoint duing deployments using AzureML SDK V2?

# Response A

To enable debugging of a ManagedOnlineEndpoint during deployments using AzureML SDK V2, you can use the `--vscode-debug` flag when creating or updating an Azure Machine Learning online deployment. You can also set the `vscode-debug` and `local` flags when creating or updating an Azure Machine Learning online deployment in Python. This will use Docker and VS Code development containers to build and configure a local debugging environment. Once the image successfully builds, your dev container opens in a VS Code window. You can then use the VS Code extensions to debug your deployments in the dev container.

# Response B

To enable debugging of a ManagedOnlineEndpoint during deployments using AzureML SDK V2, you can use the `--vscode-debug` flag when creating or updating an Azure Machine Learning online deployment. Here's an example Python code snippet that shows how to do this:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.ai.ml.entities import (
    ManagedOnlineEndpoint,
    ManagedOnlineDeployment,
    Model,
    CodeConfiguration,
    Environment,
)
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Set up variables for the workspace and endpoint
subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
workspace_name = "<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>"
endpoint_name = "<ENDPOINT_NAME>"

# Get a handle to the workspace
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
ml_client = MLClient(
    credential,
    subscription_id=subscription_id,
    resource_group_name=resource_group,
    workspace_name=workspace_name,
)

# Create a ManagedOnlineEndpoint object to configure the endpoint
endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(name=endpoint_name, auth_mode="key")

# Create a ManagedOnlineDeployment object to configure the deployment
model_name = "densenet-onnx-model"
model_version = 1
deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="blue",
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    model=Model(
        name=model_name, 
        version=model_version,
        path="./models",
        type="triton_model"
    ),
    instance_type="Standard_NC6s_v3",
    instance_count=1,
)

# Create or update the endpoint and deployment with the --vscode-debug flag
deployment = ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(
    deployment, local=True, vscode_debug=True
).result()
```

This code creates a `ManagedOnlineEndpoint` object to configure the endpoint and a `ManagedOnlineDeployment` object to configure the deployment. It then uses the `online_deployments.begin_create_or_update()` method to create or update the deployment with the `--vscode-debug` flag set to `True`. This will enable debugging of the endpoint during deployment.
