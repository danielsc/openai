# Question

Generate a python code to get ManagedOnlineEndpoint deployment logs using AzureML SDK V2?

# Response A

To get ManagedOnlineEndpoint deployment logs using AzureML SDK V2, you can use the `get_logs()` method of the `ManagedOnlineDeploymentOperations` class. Here's an example:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# configure workspace details and get a handle to the workspace
subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
workspace = "<AZUREML_WORKSPACE_NAME>"
ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)

# get the deployment logs
deployment_name = "<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>"
endpoint_name = "<ENDPOINT_NAME>"
deployment_logs = ml_client.deployments.get_logs(endpoint_name, deployment_name)
```

# Response B

You can use the `get_logs()` method of the `ManagedOnlineDeploymentOperations` class to get the logs for a deployment. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineEndpoint, ManagedOnlineDeployment
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# configure workspace details and get a handle to the workspace
subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
workspace = "<AZUREML_WORKSPACE_NAME>"
ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)

# create an online endpoint
endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(
    name="my-endpoint",
    description="this is a sample online endpoint",
    auth_mode="key",
    tags={"foo": "bar"},
)
ml_client.endpoints.create(endpoint)

# create a deployment
deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="my-deployment",
    endpoint_name="my-endpoint",
    model=model,
    environment=env,
    instance_type="Standard_DS2_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)
ml_client.deployments.create(deployment)

# get logs for the deployment
deployment_ops = ml_client.deployments
logs = deployment_ops.get_logs(endpoint_name="my-endpoint", deployment_name="my-deployment")
print(logs)
```

Replace the placeholders `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`, `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`, and `<AZUREML_WORKSPACE_NAME>` with your own values. Also, make sure to replace the endpoint and deployment names with the ones you created.
