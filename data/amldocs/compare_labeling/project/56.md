# Question

please provide a sample job yaml

# Response A

The following is a sample job YAML for an AutoML image object detection task. It includes settings for the search space, sweep settings, and job limits. It also includes an example of how to turn off certain data augmentations using the `advanced_settings` parameter. 

```yaml

# Response B

Here is a sample job YAML for an AutoML image object detection task:

```yaml
# Job name
name: automl-image-object-detection-task

# Compute target
compute:
  target: my-compute

# Input dataset
inputs:
  dataset:
    type: azureml.Dataset
    id: my-dataset

# Output folder
outputs:
  folder:
    type: azureml.OutputFile
    path: ./outputs

# Task type
task:
  type: image-object-detection
  path: ./train.py

# Search space
search_space:
  model_name:
    type: choice
    values: [yolov5s, yolov5m, yolov5l]
  learning_rate:
    type: uniform
    min_value: 0.0001
    max_value: 0.01
  batch_size:
    type: choice
    values: [8, 16, 32]

# Sweep settings
sweep:
  sampling_algorithm: random
  early_termination:
    type: bandit
    evaluation_interval: 2
    slack_factor: 0.2
    delay_evaluation: 6

# Job limits
limits:
  timeout_minutes: 60
  max_trials: 10
  max_concurrent_trials: 2

# Training parameters
training_parameters:
  epochs: 10
  advanced_settings: >
    {"apply_mosaic_for_yolo": false}
```

This YAML file defines a job that trains an object detection model using the YOLOv5 architecture. The job is run on a compute target named "my-compute" and uses a dataset named "my-dataset" as input. The search space and sweep settings are defined to explore different hyperparameters for the model. The job is limited to a maximum of 10 trials and 2 concurrent trials, and a timeout of 60 minutes. Finally, the training parameters are set to train the model for 10 epochs and turn off the mosaic data augmentation.
