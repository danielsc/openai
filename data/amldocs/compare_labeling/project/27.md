How to debug a failed Job using SSH and AzureML SDK V2?

# Response A

To debug a failed job using SSH and AzureML SDK V2, you can SSH into the compute target and navigate to the logs folder. The logs folder contains the logs for each task in the job. You can use the AzureML SDK V2 to download the logs to your local machine for further analysis. To SSH into the compute target, you need to enable SSH access when creating the compute target. You can then use the `azureml.core.compute.ComputeTarget.list_nodes()` method to get the IP address of the node to SSH into.

# Response B

You can debug a failed job using SSH and AzureML SDK V2 by following these steps:

1. Enable SSH access for your compute target by adding the `--generate-ssh-keys` flag when creating the compute target or by using the `generate_ssh_keys` method of the `ComputeTarget` object.
2. Connect to the compute target using SSH by running the `ssh` command in your terminal and providing the public IP address of the compute target and the username and private key associated with the SSH keys you generated in step 1.
3. Navigate to the job's logs directory by running `cd /mnt/batch/tasks/shared/LS_root/jobs/<job_id>/logs/azureml`.
4. View the logs for the failed task by running `cat <task_id>.log` where `<task_id>` is the ID of the failed task.
5. Use the AzureML SDK V2 to retrieve the logs for the failed task by calling the `get_logs` method of the `ParallelRunStep` object and passing in the ID of the failed task.

Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to retrieve the logs for a failed task using the AzureML SDK V2:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Experiment
from azureml.pipeline.steps import ParallelRunStep

# Set up your workspace and experiment objects
workspace = Workspace.from_config()
experiment = Experiment(workspace, 'my-experiment')

# Retrieve the parallel run step object for the failed job
run = experiment.get_run('<run_id>')
step = run.find_step('<step_name>')
failed_task_id = '<task_id>'
failed_task_logs = step.get_logs(failed_task_id)

# Print the logs for the failed task
print(failed_task_logs)
```
