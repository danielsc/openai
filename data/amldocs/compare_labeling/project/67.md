# Question

how can I schedule a job to run every day at 9am using the new CLI v2?

# Response A

You can create a schedule to run a job every day at 9am using the new CLI v2 by defining a recurrence trigger in the YAML file. Here's an example YAML file that creates a schedule to run a job every day at 9am:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/schedule.schema.json
name: daily_job_schedule
display_name: Daily job schedule
description: a daily job schedule

trigger:
  type: recurrence
  frequency: day
  interval: 1
  schedule:
    hours: [9]
  start_time: "2022-07-10T09:00:00"
  time_zone: "Pacific Standard Time"

create_job: ./my_job.yml
```

Replace `./my_job.yml` with the path to your job YAML file.

# Response B

You can create a schedule to run a job every day at 9am using the new CLI v2 by creating a YAML file with the following content:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/schedule.schema.json
name: daily_job_schedule
display_name: Daily job schedule
description: a daily job schedule

trigger:
  type: recurrence
  frequency: day
  interval: 1
  schedule:
    hours: [9]
  start_time: "2022-07-10T10:00:00"
  time_zone: "Pacific Standard Time"

create_job: azureml:<job_name>
```

Replace `<job_name>` with the name of the job you want to run. Then, run the following command to create the schedule:

```azurecli
az ml schedule create --file <path_to_yaml_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_yaml_file>` with the path to the YAML file you just created. This will create a new schedule that runs the specified job every day at 9am.
