# Question

How can I find out who submitted a job using the v2 CLI?

# Response A

To find out who submitted a job using the v2 CLI, you can use the `az ml job show` command. This command will display the details of the specified job, including the `submittedBy` field, which contains the user who submitted the job. You can also use the `--query` parameter to filter the output to only show the `submittedBy` field. For example, the command `az ml job show -n <job_name> --query submittedBy` will display only the user who submitted the specified job.

# Response B

You can use the `az ml job list` command with the `--query` parameter to filter the results by the `submittedBy` property. For example, to list all jobs submitted by the current user, you can run:

```
az ml job list --query "[?submittedBy=='$(az account show --query user -o tsv)']"
```

This command uses the `az account show` command to get the current user's email address, and then filters the job list to show only jobs submitted by that user. You can modify the query to filter by other properties as well.
