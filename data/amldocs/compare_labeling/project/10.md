# Question

can you give me a sample code I can use to test my online endpoint deployment in AzureML ?

# Response A

Sure, here is a sample code you can use to test your online endpoint deployment in AzureML:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice
from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice
from azureml.core.model import Model
from azureml.core.authentication import InteractiveLoginAuthentication

# Define the workspace and authentication
interactive_auth = InteractiveLoginAuthentication(tenant_id="your_tenant_id")
ws = Workspace.from_config(auth=interactive_auth)

# Define the deployed service
service_name = "your_service_name"
service = AciWebservice(workspace=ws, name=service_name)

# Define the input data
input_data = {
    "data": [
        [1, 2, 3, 4],
        [5, 6, 7, 8]
    ]
}

# Call the deployed service
output = service.run(input_data=input_data)

# Print the output
print(output)
```

Replace `your_tenant_id` with your Azure tenant ID, `your_service_name` with the name of your deployed service, and `input_data` with your own input data.

# Response B

Certainly! Here's a sample code you can use to test your online endpoint deployment in AzureML:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice
from azureml.core.model import InferenceConfig
from azureml.core.environment import Environment
from azureml.core.model import Model
from azureml.core.conda_dependencies import CondaDependencies
import requests
import json

# Load the workspace from the saved config file
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Set the name of the deployed model and the name of the endpoint
model_name = "my_model"
endpoint_name = "my_endpoint"

# Get the deployed model
model = Model(ws, name=model_name)

# Create a new environment
myenv = Environment(name="myenv")
myenv.python.conda_dependencies = CondaDependencies.create(
    conda_packages=["scikit-learn", "numpy"],
    pip_packages=["azureml-defaults", "inference-schema[numpy-support]"],
)

# Create an inference configuration
inference_config = InferenceConfig(
    entry_script="score.py", environment=myenv
)

# Deploy the model as a web service on Azure Container Instances
deployment_config = AciWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores=1, memory_gb=1)
service = Model.deploy(
    workspace=ws,
    name=endpoint_name,
    models=[model],
    inference_config=inference_config,
    deployment_config=deployment_config,
)
service.wait_for_deployment(show_output=True)

# Test the deployed model
scoring_uri = service.scoring_uri
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
data = {
    "data": [
        [1, 2, 3, 4],
        [5, 6, 7, 8],
    ]
}
response = requests.post(scoring_uri, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
print(response.json())
```

This code assumes that you have already deployed a model named `my_model` and that you want to deploy it as an endpoint named `my_endpoint`. You can modify the code to use your own model and endpoint names. The code creates a new environment, sets up an inference configuration, and deploys the model as a web service on Azure Container Instances. Finally, the code tests the deployed model by sending a sample request to the endpoint and printing the response.
