How to enable create an object detection model using Azuomated ML in AzureML SDK V2 ?

# Response A

To create an object detection model using Automated ML in AzureML SDK V2, you need to follow these steps:
1. Download and transform data
2. Train an automated machine learning object detection model
3. Specify hyperparameter values for your model
4. Perform a hyperparameter sweep
5. Deploy your model
6. Visualize detections

You can find detailed code examples and use cases in the GitHub notebook repository for automated machine learning samples.

# Response B

To create an object detection model using Automated ML in AzureML SDK V2, you can follow the steps outlined in the "Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python" section of the documentation. This tutorial covers the following tasks: downloading and transforming data, training an automated machine learning object detection model, specifying hyperparameter values for your model, performing a hyperparameter sweep, deploying your model, and visualizing detections. Additionally, the "Train a small object detection model with AutoML" section provides information on how to enable tiling during training to improve the model's ability to detect small objects in high-resolution images.
