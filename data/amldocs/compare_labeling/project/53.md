# Question

how do I shut down a compute instance using the v2 cli?

# Response A

To shut down a compute instance using the v2 CLI, use the `az ml compute stop` command followed by the name of the compute instance and the resource group it belongs to. For example, to stop a compute instance named "mycompute" in the "myresourcegroup" resource group, use the following command:

```
az ml compute stop -n mycompute -g myresourcegroup
```

This will stop the compute instance and deallocate its resources.

# Response B

You can use the `az ml compute stop` command to stop a compute instance. Here's an example:

```
az ml compute stop --resource-group myresourcegroup --workspace-name myworkspace --name mycompute
```

Replace `myresourcegroup`, `myworkspace`, and `mycompute` with the appropriate values for your environment.
