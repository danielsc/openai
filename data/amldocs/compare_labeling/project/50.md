# Question

can you give me a concrete yaml file for a pipeline that would upload the data at job submission?

# Response A

Here's an example YAML file for a pipeline that uploads data at job submission:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/pipelineJob.schema.json
type: pipeline
display_name: upload_data_pipeline
jobs:
  upload_data_job:
    inputs:
      input_data: 
        path: ./data
        mode: upload
    command: echo "Data uploaded successfully"
    environment: azureml:AzureML-sklearn-1.0-ubuntu20.04-py38-cpu@latest
    compute: azureml:cpu-cluster
```

This YAML file defines a pipeline with a single job that uploads data at job submission. The `inputs` section specifies the input data to be uploaded, with the `path` set to the local path of the data and the `mode` set to `upload`. The `command` section specifies the command to be executed, which in this case is just a simple echo statement. The `environment` and `compute` sections specify the environment and compute target to be used for the job.

# Response B

Here's an example YAML file for a pipeline that uploads data at job submission:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/pipelineJob.schema.json
type: pipeline
display_name: upload_data_pipeline
jobs:
  upload_data_job:
    environment: azureml:AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@sha256:1234567890abcdef
    compute: azureml:cpu-cluster
    inputs:
      input_data:
        mode: upload
        path: ./data
    command: |
      echo "Data uploaded successfully"
```

In this example, the `input_data` input is specified with `mode: upload` and `path: ./data`. This means that the data in the `./data` directory will be uploaded to the compute target at job submission. The `command` simply echoes a message to indicate that the data was uploaded successfully.
