# Question

please provide an example of a sweep job yaml to be used with the v2 CLI

# Response A

Here is an example of a sweep job YAML to be used with the v2 CLI:

```yaml
sweep:
  sampling_algorithm: random
  early_termination:
    type: bandit
    evaluation_interval: 2
    slack_factor: 0.2
    delay_evaluation: 6

search_space:
  - model_name:
      type: choice
      values: [yolov5]
    learning_rate:
      type: uniform
      min_value: 0.0001
      max_value: 0.01
    model_size:
      type: choice
      values: [small, medium]

  - model_name:
      type: choice
      values: [fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn]
    learning_rate:
      type: uniform
      min_value: 0.0001
      max_value: 0.001
    optimizer:
      type: choice
      values: [sgd, adam, adamw]
    min_size:
      type: choice
      values: [600, 800]
```

You can use this YAML file to submit an AutoML job using the Azure CLI v2.

# Response B

Here is an example of a sweep job YAML file that can be used with the v2 CLI:

```yaml
sweep:
  sampling_algorithm: random
  early_termination:
    type: bandit
    evaluation_interval: 2
    slack_factor: 0.2
    delay_evaluation: 6

search_space:
  - model_name:
      type: choice
      values: [yolov5]
    learning_rate:
      type: uniform
      min_value: 0.0001
      max_value: 0.01
    model_size:
      type: choice
      values: [small, medium]

  - model_name:
      type: choice
      values: [fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn]
    learning_rate:
      type: uniform
      min_value: 0.0001
      max_value: 0.001
    optimizer:
      type: choice
      values: [sgd, adam, adamw]
    min_size:
      type: choice
      values: [600, 800]
```

This YAML file defines a sweep job that uses the random sampling algorithm and the bandit early termination policy. The search space includes two models (`yolov5` and `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`) with different hyperparameters. The `model_name` hyperparameter is a choice between the two models, the `learning_rate` hyperparameter is a uniform distribution between 0.0001 and 0.01 (for `yolov5`) or between 0.0001 and 0.001 (for `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`), the `model_size` hyperparameter is a choice between `small` and `medium` (for `yolov5`), the `optimizer` hyperparameter is a choice between `sgd`, `adam`, and `adamw` (for `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`), and the `min_size` hyperparameter is a choice between 600 and 800 (for `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`).
