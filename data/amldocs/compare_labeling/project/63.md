# Question

how do I deploy an MLFLow model using the v2 cli?

# Response A

To deploy an MLflow model using the v2 CLI, you can use the `az ml online-endpoint create` command. You will need to specify the name of the endpoint, the path to the model, and the instance type and count. You can also specify the deployment configuration in a YAML file. Once the endpoint is created, you can create a deployment for the model using the `az ml online-deployment create` command. You will need to specify the name of the deployment, the endpoint name, and the path to the deployment configuration YAML file.

# Response B

Here is an example of how to deploy an MLflow model using the Azure CLI v2:

```azurecli
# Set the name of the endpoint and the model
export ENDPOINT_NAME="<YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME>"
export MODEL_NAME="<YOUR_MODEL_NAME>"

# Create the endpoint
az ml endpoint create --name $ENDPOINT_NAME

# Create the deployment
az ml deployment create --name "deployment" --file deployment.yaml --endpoint-name $ENDPOINT_NAME --model-name $MODEL_NAME

# Update the deployment
az ml deployment update --name "deployment" --file deployment.yaml --endpoint-name $ENDPOINT_NAME --model-name $MODEL_NAME
```

In this example, you will need to replace `<YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME>` and `<YOUR_MODEL_NAME>` with the appropriate values for your deployment. You will also need to create a `deployment.yaml` file that specifies the details of your deployment.
