Code Samples to create a GPU cluster type AmlCompute using AzureML SDK V2?

# Response A

Here is an example code to create a GPU cluster type AmlCompute using AzureML SDK V2:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

gpu_compute_target = "gpu-cluster"

try:
    # let's see if the compute target already exists
    gpu_cluster = ml_client.compute.get(gpu_compute_target)
    print(
        f"You already have a cluster named {gpu_compute_target}, we'll reuse it as is."
    )

except Exception:
    print("Creating a new gpu compute target...")

    # Let's create the Azure ML compute object with the intended parameters
    gpu_cluster = AmlCompute(
        # Name assigned to the compute cluster
        name="gpu-cluster",
        # Azure ML Compute is the on-demand VM service
        type="amlcompute",
        # VM Family
        size="STANDARD_NC6",
        # Minimum running nodes when there is no job running
        min_instances=0,
        # Nodes in cluster
        max_instances=4,
        # How many seconds will the node running after the job termination
        idle_time_before_scale_down=180,
        # Dedicated or LowPriority. The latter is cheaper but there is a chance of job termination
        tier="Dedicated",
    )

    # Now, we pass the object to MLClient's create_or_update method
    gpu_cluster = ml_client.begin_create_or_update(gpu_cluster).result()

print(
    f"AMLCompute with name {gpu_cluster.name} is created, the compute size is {gpu_cluster.size}"
)
```

# Response B

Here is an example code to create a GPU cluster type AmlCompute using AzureML SDK V2:

```python
from azureml.core.compute import AmlCompute, ComputeTarget
from azureml.core.compute_target import ComputeTargetException

# Choose a name for your GPU cluster
gpu_cluster_name = "gpu-cluster"

# Verify that cluster does not exist already
try:
    gpu_cluster = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name=gpu_cluster_name)
    print("Found existing cluster, use it.")
except ComputeTargetException:
    # To use a GPU cluster, set the vm_size parameter to one of the supported GPU sizes, such as Standard_NC6
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size="Standard_NC6", max_nodes=4)

    # Create the cluster
    gpu_cluster = ComputeTarget.create(ws, gpu_cluster_name, compute_config)

gpu_cluster.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

This code creates a GPU cluster named "gpu-cluster" with a maximum of 4 nodes and a vm_size of "Standard_NC6". If the cluster already exists, it will use the existing cluster.
