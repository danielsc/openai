# Question

how can I use my csv file in a job using the v2 cli?

# Response A

To use a CSV file in a job using the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2, you can define the input in the YAML file for the job. For example, you can define an input named `my_csv` with the type `uri_file` and the path to the CSV file. Then, you can reference this input in the command for the job using the `${{inputs.my_csv}}` syntax. When you run the job, the CSV file will be available in the job's working directory.

# Response B

You can use your CSV file in a job using the v2 CLI by specifying the path to the file in the `inputs` section of your job YAML file. Here's an example YAML file that shows how to use a CSV file as an input to a job:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/CommandJob.schema.json

code: src
command: python my_script.py --input-csv ${{inputs.my_csv}}
inputs:
  my_csv:
    type: uri_file
    path: https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myfile.csv
environment: azureml:AzureML-Minimal@latest
compute: azureml:cpu-cluster
```

In this example, the `inputs` section specifies that the input is a file (`type: uri_file`) and provides the path to the file (`path: https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myfile.csv`). 

You can then create the job using the `az ml job create` command and specifying the YAML file:

```bash
az ml job create --file my_job.yaml
```

This will create a job that runs the `my_script.py` script and passes the path to the CSV file as an argument.
