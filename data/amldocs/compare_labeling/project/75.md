# Question

I'm trying to access the files/artifacts located in the code tab under an AzureML job. How can I download the code of a job with the v2 CLI?

# Response A

You can download the code of an AzureML job with the v2 CLI by using the `az ml job download` command. You need to specify the job ID and the target directory where you want to download the code. For example, to download the code of a job with ID `my_job_id` to the directory `./my_job_code`, you can run the following command: `az ml job download --job-id my_job_id --target-dir ./my_job_code`.

# Response B

You can download the code of an AzureML job with the v2 CLI by using the `az ml job download` command. You will need to specify the `--name` and `--output-directory` parameters to specify the name of the job and the directory where you want to download the code. Here's an example command:

```
az ml job download --name my_job --output-directory ./my_job_code
```

This will download the code of the `my_job` job to the `./my_job_code` directory.
